Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\\' Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager. \"City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\\'s potential financial position over the long term,\" Stachowicz said in an email interview. \"We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\" Project Toto complements the city\\'s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\\'s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand. The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\\'s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments \"This really isn\\'t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\" Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. \"What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\" Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables. The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto. \"It\\'s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\" Mayor Robb Davis said. \"You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\" Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\\'s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances. There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget. \"It\\'s something I have been very much supportive of,\" Davis said. \"Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [ ] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\" ',\n",

       "{u'  GreenMetric names UC Davis the greenest university overall The University of Indonesia\\'s seventh annual Greenmetric ranking has declared UC Davis the world\\'s most sustainable university.  By using environmental conservation and carbon footprint reduction criteria, UC Davis achieved an aggregate score of 8,396 out of 10,000, while the two runner-ups scored 8,079 and 7,658. UC Davis was ranked highest out of the universities for transportation, including bus and bike usage as part of environmentally-friendly public transportation. \\xa0 UC Davis also achieved a perfect score of 1,800 in the waste section, regarding waste treatment, recycling, paper and plastic policies and sewerage disposal.  The ranking, which was announced on Dec. 16, highlights universities that are combating global climate change as well as bolstering energy and water conservation, waste recycling and green transportation.  UC Davis scored far ahead of other University of California (UC) campuses, with UC Berkeley earning a 7,156 and UC Riverside earning a 5,346. 516 universities were included in this ranking.  Riri Fitri Sara, chairperson of University of Indonesia GreenMetric Rankings of World Universities, congratulated UC Davis on this accomplishment. \"UI GreenMetric team is proud to announce [UC Davis] as the greenest and most sustainable campus in 2016 UI GreenMetric Rankings of World Universities,\" Sara said via e-mail. \\xa0\"We congratulate [the] UC Davis team for their achievement in making their campus an excellent example for some criteria in UI GreenMetric.\" Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter announced his gratitude toward the UC Davis community in helping reach this impressive position. \"This ranking not only reaffirms our standing as a global leader in sustainability, but also demonstrates our continuing commitment,\" Hexter said in a press release. \"All the credit goes to our staff, faculty, and students for being so dedicated to this cause.\" According to Camille Kirk, UC Davis\\' assistant director of sustainability, the score reflects the continuous efforts of the university community.  \"Maybe our UC Davis DNA includes a motivation for sustainability because we have been doing this work for decades,\" Kirk said. \"The way we run the campus, what we research, what we teach students and many of the activities our campus community undertakes all contribute to striving for a more sustainable campus and a more sustainable future for the globe.\" In addition to existing sections of transportation, setting and infrastructure, waste, water and energy and climate change, GreenMetric added an education section in 2012, measuring student performance and achievement. UC Davis has a high individual score of 1,382 within education. \\xa0 \"Being externally recognised as number one in the world for our efforts is wonderful,\" Kirk said. Anthony Estrada, a third-year managerial economics student, said that he is proud of this achievement, and believes that environmental sustainability is one of UC Davis\\' drawing factors. \"I chose UC Davis for the academics, but other factors like being really green and environmentally friendly are important,\" Estrada said. \"I know that\\'s one of the things that makes UC Davis special.\"': 35,\n",
       " u' 250 institutions ask new administration to address challenges of climate change Last month, Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter and other University of California (UC) leaders signed a letter urging President-elect Donald Trump and Congress to take action against climate change.  The letter, compiled by Boston-based nonprofit Second Nature, focuses on three main proposals. The first proposal asks for participation in the Paris Agreement on climate change, the second proposal asks for support for research in academic institutions and federal agencies and the third proposal asks for investments in the low carbon economy to help adapt to changing climate hazards.  The letter also emphasizes the importance of the government\\'s actions to influence current and future generations. It has been signed by 250 institutions and was sent to the incoming presidential administration on Jan. 13. Timothy Carter, the president of Second Nature, explained that the group worked with a group of approximately 30 schools to craft and refine the letter in November. Several other institutions\\' presidents and chancellors voluntarily submitted additional statements of support.  \"The intention of the letter was to provide a strong signal from the higher education sector that the sector values the Paris Agreement, thinks continued climate research is critical for informed decision-making and recognizes the importance of investments in a clean energy economy,\" Carter said via e-mail. Janna Cohen-Rosenthal, climate programs director for Second Nature, added that the higher education climate community voices its support for the three proposals as well as introduce the new administration and Congress to ongoing efforts.  \"We have worked with the previous administration, so it\\'s important to introduce this [ ] during a time of transition,\" Cohen-Rosenthal said via e-mail.  Carter and Cohen-Rosenthal expressed the importance of having a reference point for future policy conversations at all levels of government \\u2014 local, state and federal \\u2014 as well as providing the higher education community opportunities to partner with governments both nationally and internationally.  At UC Davis, students and faculty have been supportive of efforts to protect the environment and improve sustainability through education, research and initiatives. Professor Arnold Bloom, from the Department of Plant Sciences, expressed his approval of the effort to help influence policies of the new administration. \"Climate change is likely to become one of the most disruptive issues in the coming decades, and the steps outlined in the letter are critical for mitigating or adapting to such change,\" Bloom said via e-mail.  According to Bloom, the campus offers courses about climate change, such as introductory course SAS 25. Bloom teaches a free online course as well. The environmental policy analysis and planning major recently initiated a climate change policy track where students can learn about climate policy, environmental economics and climate science.  Michael Bancroft, a fourth-year environmental science and management major, supports the UC leaders signing the letter. \"It is very important that the UC system supports government action on climate change not only as representatives of leading environmental research institutions, but also partially as representatives of California, the state with the most legislative action on climate change in the U.S.,\" Bancroft said via e-mail.  Similarly, Mayra Pelagio, a fourth-year environmental science and management major, said that it was important for the UC system to show support for the letter considering many of its campuses were leaders in research in green energy. Pelagio and Bancroft feel that UC Davis offers many opportunities for its students to get involved in research and in environmental science more generally. There are on-campus clubs, the Green Initiative Fund and several professors who conduct research on climate change.  Both Pelagio and Bancroft also think that there is room for improvement, especially with regard to increasing environmental awareness. Bancroft believes that, while classes can provide a holistic view, it may be necessary to engage with the general population more frequently concerning current events and environmental policy.  \"There are some students, for instance, that graduate without having an understanding of concepts such as climate change,\" Pelagio said. \"These issues should be taught to everyone, for us to be aware of our impact in the environment.\" \\xa0': 40,\n",
       " u' 35th annual tree lighting ceremony kicks off with Davis Food Co-op sponsored event Candles lit the streets of Davis on Dec. 1 as children of all ages join in on the annual Children\\'s Candlelight Parade. The event has been a staple in Davis for 35 years.  \"The Children\\'s Candlelight parade is one of Davis\\' most time-honored holiday traditions,\" said Lucas Frerichs, a Davis city councilmember. \"It\\'s such a great experience to see the community gather at the Davis Food Co-op and make their way to the E Street Plaza for the holiday tree lighting and other festive holiday activities.\" The parade and tree lighting ceremonies are two of Davis\\' oldest community traditions, organized by many members of the City of Davis and produced by Bob Bowen, Davis city manager. \"The annual Children\\'s Candlelight Parade has been sponsored by the Davis Food Co-op for over two decades,\" Bowen said in a press release.  Children who wish to participate in the parade received free candles with safety drip cups courtesy of the Davis Food Co-op. The Co-op also accepted voluntary donations to the Wallace and Vannucci Women and Children\\'s Shelter prior to the parade.  \"The candlelight parade is one of the ways that we partner with the City of Davis every year,\" said Lis Harvey, marketing manager of the Davis Food Co-op. \"The City of Davis puts on a beautiful kick off to the holiday season with the tree lighting ceremony downtown, and we host the Children\\'s Candlelight Parade portion, which is how that whole evening starts.\" The candlelight parade winds through Downtown Davis, past decorated storefront windows garnished for the Christmas holiday.  \"It\\'s this super sweet Davis event, and every business downtown participates in some sort of fun way, and one of the things we love about it is it\\'s not a commercial way for us to feel festive,\" Harvey said. Since the final destination of the parade is the tree lighting, Davis residents can just follow the halo of light and chatter of children as they make their way downtown.  \"Walkers, strollers, wagons and bicycles are welcome and festive holiday lighting on parade entries is encouraged,\" Bowen said in a press release.  \"It\\'s an opportunity for people of all ages to spend a festive evening in downtown Davis as we prepare for the upcoming holiday season,\" Frerichs said.  \\xa0': 95,\n",
       " u' 971 individuals were killed by the police in 2016 Every year, the Department of Chicana/o Studies creates an altar for Dia de los Muertos with staff, students and others in the ethnic studies departments. This year, the department built a community altar in memory of victims of police violence in 2016. The altar was located in the Hart Hall stairway corridor from Oct. 18 to Nov. 14.  Additionally, the department hosted a reflection and discussion about the meaning of Dia de los Muertos and police violence on Nov. 7. \"This year, given the huge number of victims of police violence in our communities (i.e, Native American, African American, Latina/o and Trans, for example), it was decided that the altar should honor and reflect on the victims of police violence in 2016,\" said Natalia Deeb Sossa, a professor in the Chicana/o department, via e-mail. Since Nov. 11, 2016, 971 people have been killed by the police.  The altar and artwork at the memorial included photos of all of the victims, calacas and calaveras (skeletons and skulls), flowers, posters and food offerings. The altar became a space to discuss and address police violence. \"Given the prevalence of police violence in the media (and hidden from the media) the altar became a space, built in community, to address the issues currently affecting our communities [ ] knowing that this is a very difficult and painful subject, we offered a space to reflect, heal and discuss police violence in our communities,\" Sossa said via e-mail.

       " u' AMCP award recognizes excellence in marketing, communications The Sexual Violence Awareness and Education (SVAE) Campaign, a project aimed at encouraging students at UC Davis to take an active role in preventing sexual assault, has won a MarCom Award for its achievements in marketing and communications.  The Association of Marketing and Communication Professionals (AMCP), which administers the award, reviewed 6,500 entries throughout the United States, Canada and 17 other countries. The SVAE Campaign received a Platinum Award, the highest award in the competition. \"MarCom Awards recognizes outstanding achievement by creative professionals involved in the concept, direction, design and production of marketing and communication materials and programs,\" said Ed Dalheim, the executive director of AMCP, in a press release. \"Judges are industry professionals who look for companies and individuals whose talent exceeds a high standard of excellence and whose work serves as a benchmark for the industry.\" Sam Alavi, a fourth-year sociology major and co-chair of the Gender and Sexuality Alliance Network (GSA), attributed that the effectiveness of the campaign was due to its prevalence on campus. \"I think my approach to sexual violence prevention education is that it really has to saturate every aspect of campus,\" Alavi said. \"So not only in our classrooms or our orientations, and kind of embedded it in our curriculum, but also embedded everywhere else in student life, which was the idea behind the coffee sleeves and the posters and our sexual assault videos, all of those were [ ] meant to remind students about consent and bystander prevention in all the other moments of their lives at UC Davis, and I think we did a pretty good job of it.\" Andrew McDaniel, a campaign specialist for Student Affairs Marketing and Communications who oversaw the campaign, said that the campaign has effectively helped students have conversations about consent. \"For me personally, working on this campaign is incredibly rewarding,\" McDaniel said via email. \"These topics can sometimes be uncomfortable for people to talk about, but the campus has reacted very positively to the messages. It\\'s exciting to help facilitate these necessary conversations.\" The campaign also recently won a Silver Award in the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) District VII Awards of Excellence. The campaign has also started another segment called \"Dear Survivors,\" which is a series of photos that aim to support and empower survivors of sexual assault.\\n \"We started the letters to survivors project, which is kind of like a visual forum where people can write letters to themselves or to their loved ones or to survivors in general, and really give them affirmation, and part of my inspiration around was because of Donald Trump, was because of all of these things happening,\" Alavi said. \"You know it\\'s kind of emotionally exhausting to talk about this all the time. We don\\'t really talk about survivors, ever. Even in the beginning of this campaign, it\\'s very towards preventing sexual violence and not really towards what do we do and how do we support survivors after it happens, and so I think the next part of the campaign for me was making sure they were talking about survivors and how to support them and how to empower them.\" While the campaign released its first set of photos last quarter, its full launch will come in April as part of National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. \"I\\'m very proud of the work that we have done so far,\" McDaniel said. \"It\\'s been amazing to watch so many people across campus come together to support this campaign.\" Regarding the long-term effects of the campaign, Alavi said that students will be able to remember what they learned through the campaign after they graduate, which could help advance sexual assault awareness for generations to come.': 28,\n",
       " u\" ASUCD held its first senate meeting of Winter Quarter on Thursday, Jan. 1. ASUCD Vice President Abhay Sandhu called the meeting to order at 6:10 p.m. Senator Sam Park was absent and Senator Ricardo Martinez arrived late.  Senator Irveen Grewal was elected senate president pro-tempore. The president pro-tempore is the official representative of the ASUCD Senate and is elected each quarter.  Public discussion began with an appeal for Housing Day volunteers by Juliana Luna, director of the Housing Advising for Undergraduate Students unit. Environmental Policy and Planning Commission chair Sarah Fisher presented a proposal concerning the environmental impact of houseboats and was directed to a member of ASUCD administration.  Kevin Blue, the UC Davis athletics director introduced Dan Hawkins, the new head football coach. Hawkins gave a short speech about the campus, his experiences coaching football around the world and his desire to make a difference through football. He stressed the importance of the creativity and dedication in football and ensuring that players focus on both sports and academic excellence. The floor then opened to the senators to question Hawkins.  Internal Affairs Commission chair Nick Flores asked what football can do to engage students and increase school spirit. Hawkins proposed ideas of contacting Greek life, having camps or clinics or following a past strategy of marching football players through the campus and residential areas.  Gender and Sexuality Commission chair Alison Tam questioned how football players were educated on consent, sexual harassment and cultural competency. Hawkins responded that players were required to undergo a program when they come to campus and would be required to repeat it once they began football season. Hawkins concluded by stating that football players' academic progress rate was very high and that football staff was very strict about keeping players on a path to academic success. Next, senators were assigned to ASUCD committees and units. Senators nominated themselves or other senators for open positions, and roll call votes were held if there were more nominated senators than positions available.  Following presentations and assignments, legislation was presided over. Senate Bill #10, introduced by Joshua Dalavai, concerns giving marketing money to the Aggie Reuse Store. The bill was tabled. SB #15, introduced by Internal Affairs Commissioner Jacob Engel, concerned a $1,000 ASUCD volunteer award. Senator Julie Jung wanted the bill to be an incentive to volunteer and a way to recognize volunteers of ASUCD without whom many ASUCD operations would not be able to function efficiently. SB #20, also authored by Engel, concerned awarding temporary/trial scholarships that do not fall under the ASUCD Bylaws.  After some corrections, the bills moved into public discussion. Controller Joe DeAngelo expressed concerns over both bills because senators have not been identified to sit on the committee and there was no outline to what method would be used to award money. There was concern over taking money from senate reserves that could be given to staff or misused. Additionally, certain committees and units that were not as active and had fewer volunteers were less likely to be recognized. After discussion by the senators, the bills were called into question by Senators Sofia Molodanof and Shaitaj Dhaliwal, respectively. SB #15 and SB #20 both failed with a vote of 0-11-1, with abstentions by Park.  SB #30, authored by Flores, asks to remove section 1410 of the ASUCD Bylaws titled: My Student Government Channel, as it was not in use. Senator Irveen Grewal moved to call SB #30 into question and the bill was passed 11-0-1, with an abstention by Park.  New legislation was introduced and will be sent to committees in the following weeks. There are bills to allocate $650 to the Aggie Public Arts Committee for its piano project, recognize the longstanding symbiotic relationship between ASUCD and the Student Alumni Association, change staff pay from hourly salaries to stipends for The California Aggie's 2017 budget and incorporate UndocuALLY and Sexual Assault Bystander Intervention training into the ASUCD Senate's mandated trainings.\": 32,\n",
       " u' Action Jackson known for quality breeding, extroverted personality The UC Davis Horse Barn at the Cole Facility recently lost its famous breeding donkey named Action Jackson, who died on Jan. 6 at the age of 29 due to serious and chronic laminitis.  In recent years, he developed a sway back and his teeth began to fail him. He suffered from degenerative suspensory ligament desmitis (DSLD), a systemic disease of the connective tissue, according to his veterinarian. Arthritis stiffened several of his joints, and his feet were in pain. Toward the end of his life, Action Jackson lived on pelleted feed so that he could maintain his body condition in spite of his inability to eat hay. Action Jackson, a light-colored Spanish mammoth donkey, was born in 1987. He came to live at UC Davis in September 1996, when Pat Downing of Tucson donated him to stand as stud in the Department of Animal Science\\'s breeding herd. During his 20 years of service to UC Davis, Action Jackson bred 500 mares and jennies and produced a new generation of California-bred mules and donkeys who compete in sports or pack supplies. According to Dan Sehnert, the facilities coordinator for the Department of Animal Science, Action Jackson got his name because he saw a lot of \"action.\"  Action Jackson\\'s first UC Davis offspring was born in 1997 and was the first mule born on campus in 60 years.  Action Jackson quickly attracted many who visitors who enjoyed his outgoing personality and his enthusiastic braying. He became such an icon that, in 2004, a bronze sculpture was created in his honor named \"The Jack,\" which was donated to be sold for the raising of funds to improve the department\\'s equine facilities. Sehnert was well-acquainted with Action Jackson and said that he loved the attention, especially from children, as well as anything sweet.  \"He had such a great and loving personality,\" Sehnert said. \"He really loved children. He also loved anything sweet. Donuts, Starbursts and peppermints were his favorites.\"  Sehnert\\'s favorite memory of Action Jackson was seeing him interact with all of the visitors on Picnic Day.  Action Jackson also became well-known outside of UC Davis. At Mule Days, held every Memorial Day in Bishop, Calif., also known as the \"Mule Capitol of the World,\" Action Jackson was known for bringing quality mule breeding to the West Coast and distinction to the UC Davis breeding program. Amy Mclean, the equine operations supervisor for the Department of Animal Science, said that Action Jackson\\'s death was a shock to staff and students. \"Action was a kind, warm spirit; I loved driving in every day and seeing him,\" Mclean said in a statement for UC Davis News.  Nearing the end of his life, Action Jackson\\'s health care and maintenance was provided by Sharon Spier, DVM, Ph.D., professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the veterinary school.  \"He was loved and fondly caressed and fed horse treats until the end,\" Spier said. He was euthanized at his owner\\'s request, for humane reasons. Action Jackson\\'s most recent offspring, two foals born last spring, will be offered in this year\\'s June production sale, and his final offspring is expected this year. The department\\'s student equine production team also hopes to breed several mares and female donkeys using frozen semen from Action Jackson. ': 23,\n",

       " u' Awards geared toward students of color, students from underserved communities At the end of last year, the French Embassy in Washington D.C. gave the UC Davis Office of Global Affairs a grant of $19,386, while the UC Davis Study Abroad Club won a $2,000 grant from French Mission for Culture and Higher Education, located in New York City. The Transatlantic Friendship and Mobility Initiative, in collaboration with the French Embassy, aims to strengthen the ties between the U.S. and France by diversifying and doubling the number of students from France and the U.S. studying abroad in their respective countries by 2025. Under the leadership of Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor at UC Davis, UC Davis Global Affairs showed a willingness and ability to leverage the goals of the proposal. UC Davis will match the grant, making the total budget nearly $40,000. \"We were honored to be selected and awarded $20,000 by the French Embassy[,] a sum that will be matched by Vice Provost and Associate Chancellor Joanna Regulska of Global Affairs,\" said Aliki Dragona, a faculty director for UC Davis Study Abroad, via email. \"The award will promote student mobility to France and enhance partnerships with French partner institutions in 2017 and beyond.\" The budget will allocate $30,000 for 20 students studying abroad in 2017. Each award recipient must develop a project such as a video blog or photo album for outreach purposes. Half of the travel funds will be aimed toward students of color and underserved communities. \"UC Davis Study Abroad offers a robust portfolio of faculty-led programs (several in France) as well as programs through UCEAP; consequently, these student travel awards will be critical in supporting UC Davis students (and in particular, students of color and from underserved communities) studying in France in 2017,\" Dragona said via email. The application for the grant outlined a number of new initiatives with France, including the Performing Arts Live! Summer Abroad program launching in 2017 with the Institute for American Universities (IAU) College in Aix-en-Provence, and further collaboration between Summer Abroad\\'s art studio program at Paris-Sorbonne University.  Global Affairs is also working on partnerships with other French institutions for students in the arts and viticulture and enology fields. Alexandria Hartwell, a fourth-year managerial economics major, considers the grant a great opportunity for individuals to experience traveling abroad. \"I think that is is so great that the French embassy is giving UC Davis a $20,000 grant,\" Hartwell said via email. \"So many people on campus [ ] would love to study abroad but simply do not have the money. [ ] This past summer, I studied abroad with the UC Davis Fashion Marketing in Paris, France program. I enjoyed myself greatly and appreciated the chance to travel that the program afforded me.\" Hartwell is not surprised by the French government\\'s decision to aid the program. \"Once I actually placed my feet on a Paris sidewalk and had a chance to look around, I was truly amazed and surprised,\" Hartwell said via email. \"Having been in France, I\\'m not surprised in the least that wonderful people are generously facilitating the study abroad experiences for our Davis students.\" Dragona believes the grant is both a testament to UC Davis\\' efforts and strengthens the school\\'s relationship with France. \"This is an important award for UC Davis Study Abroad because it affirms the work we do and it further builds on UC Davis\\' existing relationships with France and French partner institutions,\" Dragona said via email. The UC Davis Abroad Club was also awarded $2,000 for winning the 2016 France on Campus Award. Under the guidance of film director Wes Anderson, the award aims to discover, support and celebrate initiatives to innovatively and creatively explore France. Student organizations are expected to display French culture on their campuses and beyond by launching a France-related project with a \"unique package of funding, mentoring and networking,\" according to the website for the Cultural Services of the French Embassy.  Julianna Roy, president of the Study Abroad Club and a fourth-year psychology major, said the club plans to have a series of 360-degree videos of UC Davis students\\' experiences in France by providing participants with 360-degree cameras, creating a website for the videos and developing mobile apps that are compatible with virtual reality devices. \"As president of the Study Abroad Club and as a peer advisor at UC Davis Study Abroad, I helped design a proposal for a project that will give students an interactive experience and encourage them to study abroad in France,\" Roy said via email. Although there will be study abroad staff members helping this initiative, it will be mainly student run. \"Staff members at the Study Abroad Office will be assisting us through the process, but this project will be entirely student run,\" Roy said via email. \"We also hope to involve other students on campus who are interested in app development, or who have an interest in French culture.\"': 29,\n",
       " u' Bernie Sanders visits Sacramento to rally for Proposition 61 On the Monday before Election Day, energy ran high as an excited crowd gathered on the steps of the State Capitol building in Sacramento. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who gained widespread national prominence during his run for the Democratic nomination for president, held a rally in favor of passing Proposition 61. The proposition, which California voters eventually voted down on Nov. 8, would have restricted the state from paying more for any prescription drug than what the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs pays. Roughly 46 percent of voters supported measure. \"We are the only major country on Earth that does not in one form or another regulate the price of prescription drugs [ ] For the first time in the history of this country, the American people are going to stand up to the drug companies,\" Sanders said at the rally. Although the main focus of the rally was Proposition 61, many proponents of related causes were in attendance. The Peace and Freedom Party attended the rally to raise awareness for its third party presidential candidate, Gloria La Riva. Esteban Hernandez, the party\\'s California campaign coordinator, distributed information about his candidate at the rally. \"Bernie called himself a socialist, and the Peace and Freedom Party [ ] is a socialist party,\" Hernandez said. \"So in that sense we are similar [ ] we\\'re out here today just passing out flyers, voter information.\" Many attendees of the rally were longtime Sanders supporters. Sean Glasson, a student from the California Maritime Academy, was in attendance. \"A lot of people in the area had a lot of enthusiasm for him and I still do [ ] even though he\\'s not the nominee, he\\'s still working to make sure real progressive policies are brought back to American politics and he\\'ll always have my support for that,\" Glasson said. This is not the first time Sanders has visited Northern California. In June, Sanders visited UC Davis during his presidential campaign and drew a crowd of over 9,000 supporters.  Kelly Baker, a third-year psychology major, praised Sanders as a politician to whom she can relate. \"When I started reading up and hearing his viewpoints it was almost like a dream come true,\" Baker said. \"[Sanders is] a politician who is for students, for the people of every nationality, gender, anything that you can think of, he is there to support you [ ]. There was never hatred in anything that he said, he was never bringing anybody down.\"': 114,\n",
       " u' Books by Mail program will deliver materials straight to resident households Good news is in the air for Yolo County residents who have limited access to the Yolo County Library. Through the new Books by Mail program, books, DVDs, magazines and other library materials can be delivered right to residents\\' front doors, free of charge. Involvement in the program requires a short application process available online or over the phone. Once the process is completed, residents select the materials they wish to receive in the mail. They can even opt for the library staff to choose a custom selection of materials based on personal interests. The library ships their chosen materials in reusable canvas bags with prepaid postage. Books by Mail came about when staff at the Yolo County Library noticed how difficult it was for some residents to commute to their local libraries due to problems such as lack of transportation or limitations of illness. The library\\'s staff drew inspiration from the San Francisco Public Library\\'s Books by Mail service and worked to bring the program to Yolo County. \"This service gives residents another way to access our materials, such as movies, books, CDs and more,\" said Scott Love, library regional manager at the Yolo County Library. \"It is in line with our vision of providing opportunities for everyone to read, grow, discover and interact with one another and the world at large. The service can be an invaluable lifeline for someone who might otherwise have limited opportunities and resources at home.\" Joan Tuss, librarian II in the West Yolo Region, can see the great impact the program has already made.  \"There are 22 Yolo County residents using this service,\" Tuss said. \"Five of these residents are first-time library users, and the oldest is 95-years-old. We are sending materials to Davis, Zamora, West Sacramento, Knights Landing and Esparto. Through this service, the Yolo County Library is improving access and providing library materials to community members unable to use typical library services.\"  A recent survey was conducted to acquire user reviews, with responses such as \"You picked out books I really enjoy\" and \"The service is great!\" extolling the benefits of the program. Books by Mail has been made possible by an Institute of Museum and Library Services grant, the Pinkerton Foundation, the California State Library and donations from the community and the Friends of the Davis Public Library.': 88,\n",
       " u' Burrowing Owl Preservation Society sues City of Davis for improper assessment of environmental impact of Marriott hotel The Burrowing Owl Preservation Society (BOPS), which aims to educate the public and support conservation efforts for our feathered friends, filed a lawsuit on Jan. 5 against the City of Davis for its insufficient report on the environmental implications of the Marriott Residence Inn building site. A pair of burrowing owls lives on the vacant plot of land located on Fermi Place, near the Mace Boulevard and 2nd Street intersection in East Davis. The hotel, which plans to break ground this fall, will stand four-stories tall with 120 rooms, a meeting room and other amenities; however, the burrowing owls will no longer have a place to reside once the project beings. In 2007, BOPS conducted a study that counted 63 breeding pairs of burrowing owls in Yolo County. In 2014, a census calculated that the estimated population declined to 15 breeding pairs. This sharp decline was attributed to a loss of habitats, a presence of predators and the California drought. Burrowing owls were once extensively dispersed and were considered common birds but they have substantially dwindled down in the past half century. Now the population stands as a State Species of Special Concern and a Federal Bird of Conservation Concern. Janet Foley, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the School of Veterinary Medicine, works as a board member for the BOPS. Foley hopes to create a dialogue between conservationists, the City of Davis and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) to protect these owls, which can then be a model for better protection for birds statewide. \"In Davis, virtually every spot that used to have owls has no owls,\" Foley said. \\n\"This is in my backyard and I feel that this city presents itself as environmentally friendly. I think it\\'s really important in a university town that it is environmentally friendly and we take care of one of our most endangered resources.\" Attorney Dan Mooney is representing BOPS for this case. BOPS alleges the council inaccurately concluded that the construction of the hotel would not have a substantial effect on the environment despite the abundant evidence that proves otherwise. The complaint called into question the city council\\'s decision to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) for the Marriott property. An MND states that an initial study yielded no significant impact on the environment and that certain mitigations will reduce or eliminate the implications of the project; no further studies are needed. It assesses whether there may be a slight impact on the surrounding habitat but certain mitigations lessen or eradicate the aftereffects to less than significant, as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). \"We are not opposed to the hotel,\" said Catherine Portman, the BOPS president. \"Our issue is not with the developer or the builder. Our issue is with the City of Davis certifying an MND as an adequate level of CEQA review when there are burrowing owls on the property. They should not count eviction as mitigation.\" BOPS decided to take legal action to call attention to the shortcomings of CEQA and of Davis\\' leadership. The council\\'s MND called for \"passive relocation\" of the fowl. BOPS strongly opposed this mitigation and explained that this method evicts the owls from their burrows, which the CDFW still allows and routinely practices. \"Passive relocation\" involves installing one-way doors on the burrows, which provide owls with shelter year-round. Once the owls leave the burrow, they cannot return. The owls are often harmed through the repercussions of this forced removal and may not always find new places to burrow due to existing developments, much like in the case of the pair at Fermi Place.  \"City council made a statement on Tuesday night (Jan. 24) at the council meeting [that] the council believes the city went beyond what is legally required in mitigating the impact of the project on burrowing owls,\" said Katherine Hess, a Davis community development administrator. \"We believe that petitioners should take their concerns to [CDFW] since they are the regulating agency and the city must comply with Fish and Wildlife requirements.\"': 69,\n",
       " u' CalRecycle donates $197,851 The City of Davis will soon have new recycling bins throughout town thanks to a $197,851 grant awarded by the State Department of Resources, Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle).  \"The funds will be used to purchase new recycling bins for the Downtown core area, parks and greenbelts and to purchase a few solar compacting trash/recycling units,\" said Jennifer Gilbert, conservation coordinator for the City of Davis Public Works Department in an email interview.  With new bins, waste overflow and crew maintenance will be reduced. Currently, many of the existing bins lack clear labeling and are too small to allow items to be placed inside, causing bins downtown to regularly overflow with waste. Because of the excessive amount of waste production, park crews spend hours each day managing this waste issue. \"Our parks crews spend 5 hours a day, 7 days a week emptying bins from Downtown Davis. Within hours of the bins being emptied, they are overflowing again,\" Gilbert said.  To help relieve crew workers and reduce waste production in the city, Gilbert suggested that residents divert personal waste into recycling and organics bins at home and at work.  In downtown Davis, the new grant funds will also go toward solar powered bins. Solar powered bins crush waste to reduce overflow and, once full, alert the city through a messaging system that the bins can be emptied. It is grant funds like these from CalRecycle that make purchasing new and innovative waste solutions a possibility in Davis and throughout the state.  Each year, CalRecycle, a department within the California Environmental Protection Agency that oversees waste handling and recycling programs, is able to award grants to hundreds of public and private entities throughout the state.  According to the CalRecycle website, \"During the 2016-2017 Fiscal Year, 172 grants were awarded totalling up to $36,926,744.\"  Gilbert said that in the future, if the recycling program receives more grant money, they will allocate more funds toward dedicated outreach.  Members of the campus community are also working hard to address waste reduction and waste production. The Waste Reduction and Recycling program, coordinated through the Office of Environmental Stewardship and Sustainability, wants to help the campus reach its zero waste goal of diverting trash from landfills by 2020.  \"In the last fiscal year, UC Davis had a 73% diversion rate, 4th among other UC campuses. We need to improve our diversion rate as the goal approaches, but we need everyone to help,\" said Sue Vang, program manager for Waste Reduction and Recycling in an email interview.': 60,\n",
       " u' Campus winery aims to remain environmentally sustainable Due to the passing of state law on Jan. 1, the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and Enology can now avoid pouring student products down the drain \\u2014 and these high quality bottles of wine won\\'t be cheap. The newly-established California law introduced by former Senator Lois Wolk, Senate Bill 683, allows the university to sell its student-produced wine to other wineries for handling. \"[The law] authorizes the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) to issue a special nonprofit sales license to a nonprofit mutual benefit corporation that is associated with the Department of Viticulture and Enology at UC Davis,\" the law reads. The department has been discussing the complex process with campus counsel, but must first get approval from the university to form a nonprofit organization, obtain an official license from the ABC and draw funds from the federal government. David E. Block, Department of Viticulture and Enology chair, said bachelor\\'s and master\\'s students are able to gain a hands-on experience in the department\\'s wine production lab. To meet the class\\' wine excellence standards, the state law authorizes underage students to engage in all aspects of the class, including wine tasting. The department collects its grapes for wine production classes from the vineyards on campus, from its Oakridge Station in Napa Valley and from donations from companies that value what chief campus counselor Jacob Appelsmith calls the \"next generation of winemakers.\" Of the 70 to 100 tons of grapes that the department crushes every harvest season, Block said about 250 to 300 different batches of wine are made, which translates to between five and seven thousand gallons per year. \"The plan with the new legislation is to sell most of this wine to the bulk market,\" Block said. \"It would end up getting sent to other wineries and they would mix it with their wine, package it and sell it.\" Appelsmith said the department will most likely operate with California wineries it currently has connections to through research purposes and grape purchases. According to Block, UC Davis works closely with Silverado Vineyards in Napa Valley to produce wines with similar qualities to those at UC Davis, arriving at its $80 value. \"The $80 bottle of wine is really a function of how good our land is [at] Oakville Station, the quality of grape we\\'re producing and the quality of wine,\" Appelsmith said. Despite the money involved in the wine market, Appelsmith and Block said it is crucial the department does not have a profit motive and stays true to its ultimate goal of environmental conservation. After all, UC Davis is home to the most sustainable winery in the world and is Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certified. \"We don\\'t want to have to just throw the wine away because of primarily the environmental issues and just the general wastefulness of it,\" Appelsmith said. \"The idea that you would have to take a perfectly good product and pour it down the drain when it has to be treated, is contrary to our mission.\" Block added that it would also be more financially stable for the facility to sell the wine to companies since the department can recover some of the labor, grapes and equipment costs in order to enhance student programs. Though the arrangements to sell the wine are not yet completed, Block said the department is going to expand the program next year and produce even more red and white wine varieties. \"We\\'ll be adding another class in the Spring Quarter,\" Block said. \"[Students] will take the same wines and finish them through everything after the fermentation [ ] so they can understand how to do all the rest of the steps in the winery from filtration to bottling to cleaning.\" Further developing the program is a step in the right direction, as Block hopes to take advantage of the department\\'s vineyard and one day even sell a small production of the student wine with a UC Davis label on it. \"It would be very high quality wine that would be up to UC Davis standards,\" Block said. \"[The wine] would be something students, alumni, faculty and staff could be proud of.\"': 26,\n",

       " u' Citizens can expect more cost-competitive clean energy for 2017 With rising concerns of climate change, green energy continues to gain interest in communities such as Davis and Yolo County. On Oct. 25, Davis and Yolo County representatives voted unanimously to create the Valley Clean Energy Alliance (VCEA), which aims to deliver cost-competitive clean electricity by fall 2017.  \"Community Choice Energy (CCE) programs have shown the ability to deliver consumer choice and greener electricity with competitive pricing,\" said Mayor of Davis Robb Davis, in a press release to the Davis Vanguard. \"We are in a period of rapidly changing electricity generation options and a CCE enables us to proactively be part of that change \\u2014 creating a more resilient supply of green energy to our consumers.\" The formation of the VCEA and CCE programs in Davis and Yolo County gives the communities freedom to come together collectively and purchase their electrical power rather than just buy it from an industrial utility. While customers may continue to use Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) as their main source for electricity, they now have other options as well. Currently, PG&E sources and delivers energy to residents of Davis and the greater Yolo County area. The VCEA is looking to follow in the footsteps of current CCE programs already in place throughout the state of California. Electricity will be purchased from local sources and will use greener and cleaner methods. PG&E will continue to own the transmission and distribution system because of the large investment in infrastructure pre-established, meaning that a small percentage of the rates that customers pay for VCEA electricity will go to PG&E as well.  Yolo County supervisor Don Saylor believes that this program will greatly benefit the community. \"The purpose of this authorization is to enable communities to increase the portion of the energy they purchase and consume from renewable sources and to reduce the rates that customers pay,\" Saylor said. \"This means we can generate electrical power using solar facilities that we own and operate. We can use our own power or we can purchase from renewable sources such as biogas, wind power, solar power, hydropower, and we can purchase on the open market.\"  In addition, the program is expected to increase the renewable energy portfolios of Davis and Yolo County, as well as support the implementation of Yolo County\\'s Climate Action Plan, which was adopted in 2011. The official action plan calls for \"detailed strategies and measures to achieve these goals and contribute to State and international climate protection efforts.\" ': 100,\n",
       " u' College alcohol use, high-risk drinking discussed Overall trends of public intoxication arrests in Davis have declined in recent years, said City of Davis mayor Robb Davis during the Davis Town Hall forum on Nov. 16. If only that were the case back in 2005 for one UC Davis freshman, a female student who spent a night out drinking in downtown Davis with friends and drunkenly tripped on the curb, hitting her head in a nearly-fatal incident.  \"Since 2011, fewer and fewer minors have been getting arrested,\" Davis said.  Still, Davis made sure that community members knew of the seriousness of the issue today, and that noise complaints, public urination and other alcohol-associated arrests are happening. \"B street, pee street,\" Davis said, referring to public urination in downtown Davis which happens after late nights out at local bars. Robb Davis, other notable community figures and student resource groups on campus spoke out about alcohol use and high-risk drinking during the public meeting. The meeting, titled \"Enhancing our Safety and Well-Being: Where Does Alcohol Fit In?\" was put on by the Student Health and Counseling Services (SCHS) at UC Davis. Nearly 50 Davis residents and students were in attendance.  One notable speaker was Dr. Nick Gorton, who works in the emergency room department at Sutter Davis Hospital. At the forum, he discussed the personal story of a local UC Davis student who nearly die from alcohol intoxication. He described the frantic phone calls that were made to local hospitals to see if they could treat her, as well as the dreaded phone call he had to make to the woman\\'s father to tell him that his daughter might die.  It was then that Gorton stressed to the audience that this experience could happen again unless appropriate measures from the local community and UC Davis are taken to prevent alcohol-related injury.  \"[We\\'ve] got to do something. People are going to die if we don\\'t,\" Gorton said.  Despite the bleak depiction of high-risk alcohol consumption, there was an overarching sense of hope from the various individuals who spoke. Many believed that alcohol concerns would be appropriately addressed by the community.  Thoughtful remarks were made by the president-elect of the Interfraternity Council David Bronstein, Davis Police Department officer John Renger and associate vice chancellor for student life, campus community and retention services Milton Lang. Each ensured the audience that there are improvements being made and resources accessible to students who might struggle with substance-related issues.  Jessica Bulgarelli and Melanie Hanson spoke on behalf of Aggie RISE, a support group at UC Davis that brings students together who are seeking to address recovery issues.  Bulgarelli described her personal experience of getting a DUI at 18 and having a felony on her record. Bulgarelli argued that having adequate peer support and a place on campus where students can go is helpful for those who need it. She added that it also helps erase the stigma behind alcoholism.  Similarly, Hanson explained that although the struggle of substance abuse is scary, no one should have to go through the pain by themselves. \"We at Aggie RISE are here for you. Struggling with substance abuse is lonely and isolating. You don\\'t have to alone,\" Hanson said.

       " u' Conference aims to destigmatize mental health, inspire students to engage in mental health work UC Davis will host its first ever mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Feb. 5. The UC Davis Mental Health Conference \"aims to engage students in destigmatization and education efforts, prompt attendees to organize around mental health issues and offer them the opportunity for self-reflection and healing through mental health discourse,\" according to its event page. The idea to host a conference at UC Davis began after a delegation of 16 students were sent to UC Irvine for its mental health conference in May of 2016, using funds from the Division of Student Affairs. UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara and UC Los Angeles already have mental health conferences. After the conference, Davis attendees of the Irvine conference approached ASUCD Senator Samantha Chiang, a third-year English and psychology double major, to help organize a conference at UC Davis. Chiang, who has worked on mental health efforts and helped orchestrate the trip to Irvine, became the founder and director of UC Davis\\' conference. Chiang spoke with Associate Vice Chancellor Milton Lang from the Student Affairs Office of the Vice Chancellor in May of 2016 and was able to secure some funding for the conference. She then reached out to students to help put the massive event together and warranted the help of eight board members. Over 150 people will attend the conference. Due to limited funding, 125 attendees were selected through an application process that took place online from late December to early January. 50 people were selected on the basis of personal need and the remaining spots were allocated based on ability to help give back to the community. The conference will include workshops, panels and performances from student groups as well as opening and closing remarks.  Students and professionals will run the workshops. Those involved come from departments of ASUCD such as the Office of Advocacy and Student Representation, the Gender and Sexuality Commission, the Tri Co-ops and the Asian American Studies Department.  Workshop topics include race and ethnicity; sexual assault and mental health; Question, Persuade and Refer (QPR) certification for suicide prevention; student leader mental health; body positivity/disability; LGBTQIA mental health and spiritual healing.  There will also be two panel sets. Panelists include nine panelists who applied online, three psychologists from UC Davis Counseling and Psychological Services as well as administrators. The administration panel includes the director of Student Health and Counseling Services and the director of Academic Satellites. The speakers are Monica Porter from Disability Rights Advocates and Juliet Forbes from Crisis Text Line.  \"We want this to affect people beyond the scope of the conference,\" Chiang said. \"We tried to choose workshops and panels that would give people the ability to take this outside. [ ] we really wanted to be able to inspire people to do more mental health work and really break down and destigmatize student mental health.\"  Chiang has been a vital part of bringing the conference together. Her platform in ASUCD is focused on mental health awareness and providing benefit academic and mental health communities. The conference has been her largest undertaking so far. In May, she and her associates are planning to dedicate the full month dedicated to mental health awareness.  \\xa0': 27,\n",
       " u' Conference entails full day of speakers, panels, student-led discussions UC Davis held its first mental health conference at the UC Davis Conference Center from 9 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. on Sunday Feb. 7. Over 150 students participated in a series of workshops, panel sets and activities.  After check-in and breakfast, opening remarks were given by Monica Porter, an attorney for the Disability Rights Advocates organization. Porter spoke briefly about her own experience with mental health and expressed her happiness at seeing many students participate in a mental health conference and speak openly about mental illness without fear of stigma.  The first workshop set offered students a choice between workshops about grief, minorities and mental health and an intersectional approach to healing and political activism during the Trump presidency. Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, attended the workshop which was aimed at ways to combat living in a Trump presidency.  \"We discussed the communities that are marginalized by his Presidency and ways to actively engage within our community to foster support and make change,\" Ruttkay said via email. Students were then able to choose between an administration panel and a psychologist panel. Both panels were comprised of speakers from the university\\'s colleges and representatives from Student Health and Counseling Services.The psychologist panel speakers spoke about their careers at UC Davis and gave advice to students considering studying psychology. The administration panel speakers spoke about their positions at UC Davis, their journeys from college to now and gave advice to students looking to serve in academic positions in the future.  Diana Olivan, a second-year cognitive science major, particularly enjoyed the two panels.  \"It was great to actually be able to see them and hear about their experiences,\" Olivan said. \"It definitely helps in trying to figure out what career paths there are.\" Next, students broke into caucuses that served as a healing space and allowed students to share their stories and talk openly without fear of being judged. Some students chose to go into a caucus where they could identify as neurodivergent, or anything that is not typically defined as \"normal,\" while others chose to attend one for allies of neurodivergent people.  Olivan attended the workshop for those who identify as neurodivergent.  \"I had a general sense of what neurodivergent meant but it seemed like a lot of the people who went were just interested in figuring out what neurodivergent means,\" Olivan said.  Olivan hopes that in the future, the workshop will be used as more of a healing opportunity, as was originally intended.  After lunch, students attended a second workshop set and chose between gender based violence and mental health, suicide prevention and body image/self-love workshops. \"We had an open discussion about the way media portrays the standards of beauty, how certain body-[inspiration] campaigns are not intersectional and why all bodies are beautiful,\" Ruttkay said.  Students were then given a choice to attend one of three student panels. Student panelists were selected after an online application process, and shared their personal stories and struggles with mental health. The student panel helped Ruttkay personally understand how differently abled students are marginalized and disregarded on campus.  \"The students who shared their testimonies over their conditions really struck a chord with me,\" Ruttkay said. \"I was hearing their stories on a very raw level that opened up an even great[er] sense of care and compassion for mental health.\"  Student groups gave performances after a short break. Performers included individual students as well as the student groups Unbound Progression, The Liquid Hotplates and Baile de Fuego.  Another three workshops were then offered about LGBTQIA mental health care and support, spiritual healing and self care. In an action planning set, students had the opportunity to share what they planned to do in the future for minorities in terms of support and activism. Shortly thereafter, dinner was served along with closing remarks by Juliet Forbes, a student at UC Davis who serves as a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line. Forbes expressed the importance of destigmatizing mental illness, supporting those struggling with their mental health and the resources Crisis Text Line offers.  The conference took place after more than nine months of planning, but still presented its challenges on the day of execution. Mental Health Conference Founder and Director Samantha Chiang, a third-year English major, found it empowering that she and her team were able to build the conference from the ground up with student voices at the forefront.  \"The biggest challenge was working out the kinks we hadn\\'t anticipated, like waiting for the workshop hosts and performers to come right before their designated times,\" Chiang said via email. Chiang said the conference was everything she had hoped for and more, and hopes that in the future she can secure enough funding to expand it into a two-day conference.  Attendees were able to appreciate the significance of the conference. Olivan found that she learned many ways to be involved in the community at Davis and that students had resources to help them feel safe and realize they are not alone.  \"A great thing about the conference was that it happened in the first place, which is a great step in developing UC Davis mental health advocacy,\" Olivan said. Ruttkay believes that the conference highlighted many differently abled conditions and participants were given the opportunity to participate in meaningful discussions. She saw another side of mental health that she believes is extremely neglected by the university.  \"The biggest takeaway from this conference was seeing how many students are passionate about advocating for mental health at an institutional level,\" Ruttkay said. Conference Panel Coordinator Jacqueline Grady, a third-year global disease biology major, hopes to expand the conference in coming years in order to continue pushing the boundaries on conversations about mental health.  \"We\\'re looking to start a qualitative conversation about mental health,\" Grady said via email. \"There\\'s a negative stigma surrounding mental health and we want to tear that wall down. The conference is only one day, but we hope the conversation continues beyond it. Our goal is to make mental health a priority on campus.\"  \\xa0': 6,\n",

       " u' Davis College Democrats host Dodd for question and answer session During the Davis College Democrats\\' (DCD) second meeting of the quarter on Jan. 18, attendees were given the opportunity to speak with California Senator Bill Dodd (D-3). \"Let me tell you, the Davis College Dems were the first Democratic organization that supported me,\" Dodd said regarding his run for the state senate in 2016. \"I\\'m telling you, it means something, and this club, I tell you, I will be at your disposal.\" After his speech, Dodd took questions from students on topics ranging from taxes and tuition, to the housing situation in Davis. \"Education is something that is really, really important to me,\" Dodd said. \"I\\'ve always represented UC Davis and Sonoma State, but now I\\'ve got Cal State Maritime Academy over in Vallejo as well, and the tuition increases that we\\'ve seen in the past have gotta come to a halt. It\\'s just unbelievable the burden that students are having to pay and obviously those that can\\'t do it all on their own have college loans, and those build up, and it\\'s just a bad deal.\" Christian Monsees, a third-year political science major and the director of finance for DCD, said that the event created an opportunity for students to engage in policy. \"It\\'s one thing to show up to a club and feel the social aspect of it,\" Monsees said. \"It\\'s another thing to actually see what their futures could be, to be exposed to career opportunities and all of that kind of thing. It\\'s always great to hear Dodd speak and hear him go through his views on California policy, which is always super interesting for our members.\" Dodd also gave students the chance to talk about getting involved in politics as student Democrats continue to regroup after the 2016 presidential election. Elizabeth Nash, a fourth-year environmental policy analysis and planning major and co-chair of the Indigo Awards, an annual fundraiser hosted by DCD, said that Dodd\\'s visit will help attract new students who might be interested in joining the group and supporting the Democratic party. \"For me, I was happy to see so many people engaged,\" Nash said. \"After the election of Trump, a lot of people on campus just felt really defeated and really scared. And at the same time, we were looking to expand our member base. So, if there\\'s going to be a silver lining, it\\'s that we\\'ve seen more people get involved in politics who really want to, not just, \\'Oh I really want to have my voice heard,\\' but show up and actually put action behind their values and what they want to see in the world.\" Dodd, who spoke for approximately 40 minutes, also encouraged new members to think about their influence on American politics. \"For those of you that are new, it does make a difference,\" Dodd said, referring to student participation in the DCD. \"What you guys do in this room, it does make a difference and the job that we have to do in the future, as Democrats in the State of California, protecting the values that we have, is going to make a difference.\" According to Nash, the event provided a space for students to share input with their state senator, allowing them to expand their understanding of the legislative process.': 19,\n",
       " u' Davis Sunrise Rotary Club grant benefits Alzheimer\\'s patients at Yolo Hospice After years of planning and working to obtain the necessary funding, Yolo Hospice received a $1,500 grant from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club, enabling it to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization. This distinction allows Yolo Hospice to provide its patients with iPods and music. Studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer\\'s or dementia who listen to music are more likely to retain their memories. In order to become a Music & Memory Care Certified Organization, a pre-certification webinar must be watched. The cost for one year of certification plus five iPods is $1,000. However, there are various other costs associated with the program other than the initial amount. Yolo Hospice asked its volunteers to look for funding through donors, and it ended up obtaining $1,500 from the Davis Sunrise Rotary Club. \"The grant was wonderful and very generous,\" said Sheryl Mahoney, a marketing and communications specialist at Yolo Hospice. \"It does not cover the total cost of the program, however. We are a nonprofit, and this relies on philanthropic support.\" Patients with Alzheimer\\'s or dementia are given a playlist, tailored to their individual personalities and based upon their past. Family members and friends are asked to determine the music style, since the genre of music doesn\\'t affect patients\\' ability to recall information; rather, the music should be something that each person can personally connect with on a deeper level. Each patient is then given two playlists, one calming and one upbeat, with 10 to 15 songs each from iTunes. \"You figure out an individual\\'s specific likes of their music, so their favorite song and the memories about the pieces of music, not necessarily the genre,\" said Nancy Johnston, the social work and spiritual care manager at Yolo Hospice. \"It\\'s more about them connecting to their past in their music.\" Although music isn\\'t said to be a complete cure for Alzheimer\\'s or dementia, it does help \\xa0bring some of the patients\\' memories back for the time being. \"[Patients are] encouraged to use iPods before bathing or bed,\" Johnston said. \"Medication is used less and music is used more, because music is more effective. Music is one of the major contributors to the quality of life.\"  The Music & Memory Care Certified Organization has proven to be beneficial for the Yolo Hospice in aiding those with Alzheimer\\'s or dementia. \"Alive Inside\" is a documentary by Dan Cohen, founder of Music & Memory, in which he tries to prove that, through music, people can regain some of their past memories and rediscover a part of themselves. This commended cinematic piece was shown at the 2014 Sundance Music Festival and won the Audience Award.  There will be a local event in the spring showing this documentary, and all are encouraged to attend to learn more about the organization. Yolo Hospice is also looking for additional donations, whether they are in the form of new or gently used iPods or monetary contributions. \"The program guides caregivers to create personalized playlists on iPods,\" said Elena Siegel, an associate professor at the UC Davis Betty Irene Moore School of Nursing. \"These personalized playlists can be used to help residents with Alzheimer\\'s, dementia and other cognitive and physical challenges reengage and reconnect with their world through familiar music-triggered memories.\" \\xa0': 67,\n",
       " u' Davis community renews local parcel tax for K-12 education Since 1984, Davis residents have voted to support local schools and education with parcel taxes that help sustain important programs and enrichment opportunities for Davis K-12 students. This election proved no different, as the votes tallied up beyond the required two-thirds majority for Measure H to pass.  Measure H employs a parcel tax to each single-family home to fund various school programs including lab sciences, arts and music, school libraries, world language, drama, speech and debate, journalism, athletics and more. It not only maintains school curriculum, but also provides funding for aides, counselors, nurses and school psychologists among other teaching positions and staff. \"It\\'s kind of like the frosting on the cake,\" said Courtenay Tessler, head counselor at Davis Senior High School. \"If you take the frosting, you would still have the cake, you would still get an education, but the things that make it better and more supportive for students would go away.\" This measure renews and slightly increases expiring taxes that each single-family home pays, which totals to $620 per parcel per year. With state budget cuts and lost revenue, this tax, which raises about $10 million per year, sustains a high quality of education in Davis schools. Measure H also exempts seniors, those receiving disability and those receiving Supplemental Security Income, but they must first file an application with the school district for the exemption. \\xa0 Educators and staff are thrilled and thankful that the community continues to support students in their education. \"It really is a testament to our amazing community,\" said Maria Clayton, the Davis Joint Unified School District public information officer. \"Time and time the community steps up to support our schools [ ] we couldn\\'t be more delighted and grateful.\" According to educators, without Measure H, the education of young students throughout Davis would have suffered \\u2014 with this funding gained by the passage of the measure, students will be able to build a foundation for better education. \"Secondary science teachers attest to a real difference they see in the science-readiness and content background that elementary science instruction provides for students entering seventh grade, which translates into more in-depth learning in middle school, and more students ready for higher-level courses,\" said Ingrid Salim, science teacher at North Davis Elementary and Holmes Junior High, in an article published by the Davis Enterprise. In the future, Davis educators hope that the community will continue to invest in young students\\' education.

       " u' Davis gets a handle on panhandling The Davis City Council recently discussed the panhandling problems downtown, particularly with regards to protecting both the safety of citizens and the rights of panhandlers. Many citizens and shop owners have expressed concerns regarding panhandlers and their possessions blocking sidewalks or the public right of way.  The solution may not be so simple, as panhandling and other forms of asking for assistance are protected by the First Amendment; however, the Council may approve ordinances regulating panhandling and solicitation. There are many options to help alleviate the growing issue, including a sit-and-lie ordinance, which the council determined to be too strict and severe for the community.  Sit-and-lie ordinances are implemented in cities where panhandlers and homeless people are much more prevalent and tend to generate additional complications. San Francisco, Palo Alto and Santa Cruz uphold sit-and-lie ordinances during certain hours; often, a warning is given before any citation or action ensues.  Davis residents rarely encounter aggressive altercations with panhandlers. City leaders actively and firmly assert that residents should take appropriate steps to ensure that the homeless population does not feel criminalized, but that the public should also feel safe.  Kelly Stachowicz, Davis\\' assistant city manager, emphasized the distinction between panhandlers and homeless people.  \"Panhandling does not equal homelessness,\" Stachowicz said. \"While they may overlap, they are different issues. Not all people who panhandle are homeless.\" Stachowicz also called attention to the numerous services and programs in Davis. She notes that the panhandler-related disturbances are subjective to the individuals involved, but that the city wants to ensure public safety.  \"I am hoping that the city is able to take a more compassionate approach than we might be able to, and just because we might be able to pass some ordinances doesn\\'t mean we should,\" said Denise Hoffner, a Davis citizen, during the Jan. 10 council meeting. \"Putting those things together [panhandling and homelessness] is not very constructive [ ] I understand the businesses are frustrated, but I would ask there would be a very compassionate response from businesses.\" One ordinance that the Davis City Council has previously implemented restricts panhandling within 50 feet of an ATM to protect citizens\\' safety and privacy. Moreover, the state of California bans aggressive panhandling and solicitation, which entails following pedestrians, using abusive language, using unwanted physical contact or blocking pedestrian or vehicular rights of way.  In addition to panhandling, there is a growing concern about possessions being left in pedestrians\\' right of way. At this time, the city has not enacted any ordinances regarding the confiscation of property, but there is a lengthy process for items left behind for extended periods of time. The city can hold the property for up to 90 days and then decide to discard or sell it so as to not violate rights protected under the Fourth and 14th Amendments. Some suggest that creating locker spaces where people can securely place their belongings may help. To further address related issues, Davis will build public restrooms downtown. The city and service providers also have information cards of local services for the homeless population and panhandlers in need of assistance.  Mayor Robb Davis expressed concern over the situation and offered some possible solutions to public safety concerns and other limitations.  \"We do want to maybe place further restrictions [on panhandling],\" Davis said. \"There was a suggestion that we also limit panhandling to people who are in their automobiles.\"': 72,\n",
       " u' Davis resident Lauren Kirk-Coehlo arrested in connection with hate crime Police arrested a Lauren Kirk-Coehlo, resident of Davis and graduate of Davis High School, on the morning of Feb. 14 as suspect in the Islamic Center of Davis vandalism case, which investigators and state and federal prosecutors have labeled a hate crime. The arrest comes after nearly a month of joint investigation by the Davis Police Department (DPD) and the FBI.  The UC Davis issued a crime alert soon after the arrest stating, \"Soon after the crime was reported, and the surveillance footage was released, the Police Department received numerous tips regarding the vandalism.\"  Kirk-Coehlo is currently booked in the Yolo County jail for felony vandalism with hate crime enhancement. The suspect faces up to six year in prison if she is convicted, and bail has been set at $1 million. Kirk-Coelho\\'s arraignment hearing is set for Feb. 16 at 1:30 p.m. \\xa0 The vandalism of the Islamic Center occurred on the morning of Jan. 22 during which an estimated $7,000 worth of damage was inflicted. The incident was caught on a surveillance camera from the mosque.  \"Video footage shows a female suspect smashing six window panes and placing something on the exterior door handle of the Islamic Center of Davis. It was later determined that strips of bacon were placed on the door handle,\" said Jonathan Raven, chief deputy district attorney in a press release. Shortly after the footage was released, The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) called on state and federal law enforcement to investigate the motive behind the vandalism. \\xa0 \"Political, religious or ideological beliefs are not an excuse to commit hate crimes,\" said Monica Miller, special agent in charge of the Sacramento FBI office in an interview with the Sacramento Bee after the arrest.   Members of the mosque have since rallied together, and with help from the Davis community, raised $20,000 dollars for repairs. ': 63,\n",
       " u' Davis residents create financial model to make city\\'s financial state more transparent To increase transparency between the city\\'s financial situation and the community, three residents created a model called Project Toto which aims to improve how the city communicates its finances in an easily accessible design.  Jeff Miller and Matt Williams, who are members of Davis\\' Finance and Budget Commission, joined together with Davis entrepreneur Bob Fung to create the model plan to bring the project to the Finance and Budget Commission in February, according to Kelly Stachowicz, assistant city manager.  \"City staff appreciate the efforts that have gone into this, and the interest in trying to look at the city\\'s potential financial position over the long term,\" Stachowicz said in an email interview. \"We all have a shared goal to plan for a sound fiscal future with few surprises. We believe the Project Toto effort will mesh well with our other efforts as we build the budget for the next fiscal year and beyond.\" Project Toto complements the city\\'s effort to amplify the transparency of city decisions to community members. The aim is to increase the understanding about the city\\'s financial situation and make the information more accessible and easier to understand. The project is mostly a tool for public education, but can also make predictions about potential decisions regarding the city\\'s financial future. Once completed, the program will allow residents to manipulate variables to see their eventual consequences, such as tax increases or extensions and proposed developments \"This really isn\\'t a budget, it is a forecast to see the intervention of these decisions,\" Williams said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. \"What happens if we extend the sales tax? What does it do given the other numbers that are in?\" Project Toto enables users, whether it be a curious Davis resident, a concerned community member or a city leader, with the ability to project city finances with differing variables.  The online program consists of the 400-page city budget for the 2016-2017 fiscal year, the previous budget, staff reports and consultant analyses. All of the documents are cited and accessible to the public within Project Toto. \"It\\'s a model that very easily lends itself to visual representation,\" Mayor Robb Davis said. \"You can see the impacts of decisions the council makes on the fiscal health of the city.\" Complementary to this program, there is also a more advanced version of the model with more in-depth analyses of the city\\'s finances. However, for an easy-to-understand, simplistic overview, Project Toto should be enough to help residents comprehend Davis finances.  There is still more to do on the project, but its creators are hard at work trying to finalize it before the 2017-2018 fiscal year budget.  \"It\\'s something I have been very much supportive of,\" Davis said. \"Transparency is not just something that I have been supportive of but something we have stated as a city council objective [ ] this fits very well with our attempt to inform the public of our challenges with our fiscal situation.\"': 64,\n",
       " u' Davis residents light candles, promote sanctuary and inclusivity As darkness fell over the crowd of people who filled the streets of Davis on Nov. 12, a halo of light surfaced from Central Park. In light of election results both controversial and complex, Davis residents gathered together for a Holding the Light ceremony to reaffirm their commitment to keeping the City of Davis a progressive and sympathetic environment.  The event, organized by Cayce Wallace, took place in downtown Davis and served as a direct response to the election of Donald Trump, signaling solidarity as a diverse and climate conscious community.  \"We have gathered as a community to bring light into the darkness that has come over our nation. Coming together in strength and solidarity so that we can get our legs back under us and move forward. We have been caught in what feels like a hurricane, but now we are in the eye, and we are finding our strength as we move forward together,\" Wallace said. Words of solidarity were followed by words of anger or anecdotes of the personal struggles people faced in the few days after the election results were announced. Candles were passed around to newcomers who stood empty handed, as community members stepped up to the microphone to share their messages of unity.  \"I\\'m not sure if we know what\\'s coming, but we want to remain faithful as representatives of the community,\" said Mayor of Davis Robb Davis.  Davis shared with the crowd an anecdote from his personal life involving his grandson Jaime. Jaime\\'s father, Davis\\'s son-in-law, is undocumented, according to Davis.  \"Jaime came home the day after the election and said to my daughter, \\'Mommy, when does mister Trump take office?\\' He\\'s in second grade. She said \\'Why do you want to know?\\', and he said, \\'Because I want to know when Papa has to go back to Mexico \\'\\u2014 Jaime\\'s afraid,\\'\" Davis said.  Davis went on to remind the audience that the community should remain tolerant, even in the face of intolerance. Davis, in his capacity as mayor, also addressed fears that the current American political climate could weaken the progressive advancements the City of Davis has made.  \"We\\'re going to prepare ourselves. [ ] Given what we have heard, we must prepare ourselves to resist. Some may feel it is unseemly for an elected official to even suggest that there would be resistance against the state, but that\\'s what I\\'m saying,\" Davis said.  His words were met with raucous cheers from the audience, however, Davis stressed that he did not use those words lightly. He explained that should the community be asked to compromise its values, Davis, among other elected officials, would defy such orders.  \"We cannot succumb to those fears. But make no mistake \\u2014 words have consequences. And words were spoken, not by accident, not by a slip of the tongue, but words were spoken during this campaign with meaning, with intent, and those words have consequences, and those consequences are that we have legitimate fear in our community today,\" Davis said. \\xa0 Also in attendance was Lucas Frerichs, a councilmember for the City of Davis, who is familiar with the Davis community as a result of 20 years as a resident. Frerichs also chose to focus on the diverse aspects of the Davis community and shared his commitment to protecting the community.  Frerichs reminded residents of Davis\\'s designation as a sanctuary city, which means that the City of Davis refuses to conduct raids for the purpose of finding and detaining undocumented immigrants. Davis is one of several cities who have shared an unwillingness to assist U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in that respect. \\xa0 \"Davis has been a sanctuary city since 1986. 30 years as a sanctuary city. That is something to celebrate. [ ] I can tell you, without a doubt, that this current city council is going to continue to uphold that standing as a sanctuary city for anyone who needs to be here and wants to be here,\" Frerichs said. With candles glowing brightly, Davis residents seemed to find solace in one another that early November night.  \"We honor that we are mad, disheartened and uncertain of things to come, and yet we are peaceful in our actions,\" Wallace said.  \\xa0': 105,\n",
       " u' Davis turkeys threaten residents, students According to the City of Davis Wild Turkey Population Management Plan, the famous turkey flock came to Davis 10 years ago when nine wild turkeys began roosting in Davis cemetery. The turkeys found ample food and few natural predators within the city, and, as a result, their population has swelled to almost 100.  Recently, Davis residents have found the turkeys have become increasingly problematic, and, while some residents find them amusing, others want the birds gone. \\xa0 \"[It\\'s] funny that we have this problem,\" said Leah Julian, a fourth-year religious studies major and lifelong resident of Davis. \"We [had] a turkey that lived in our backyard for a month during Thanksgiving time, so we would always joke that [we were going to] eat it. [ ] It was kind of annoying, but it\\'s an animal. What are you going to do about it?\" \\xa0 Her experience underscores some of the turkeys\\' more benign behaviors: defecating in yards and pecking at gardens.  \"I feel like they\\'re more of a nuisance than anything,\" Julian said. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 However, some turkeys have proven far more nefarious. Turkey flocks have a pecking order determined by aggression, and one male bird is notorious for showing aggression toward residents. He frequents the corner of 4th and F Streets and has been nicknamed \"Downtown Tom\". As a display of dominance, he chases residents through downtown.  Brock Wetzlich, an employee of the Rivers to Reef fish store, which is located on F Street, has experienced the wrath of Downtown Tom first-hand.  \"I was leaving the store and the turkey was right there. [ ] I walk out, and the turkey just starts chasing after me. [ ] [Someone] had to go shoo it away before I could go outside \\'cause it kept trying to chase me. I don\\'t know what it has with me,\" Wetzlich said. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some residents find encounters with aggressive turkeys amusing \\u2014 others even enjoy them. Ruben Nolasco, a fourth-year anthropology major who works downtown, described an incident in which a turkey stood in front of the entrance to Temple Coffee on G Street and blocked a person from entering.  \"[The person trying to enter Temple Coffee] could have gone around to the other door, but he wanted to get past the turkey, so he was also playing along too [ ] it was pretty funny,\" Nolasco said. Not everyone thinks favorably of the turkeys, however. Aggressive turkeys have prompted numerous calls to the Davis Police. The callers are often terrified and usually at a complete loss as to how to shake the turkeys off. Small children are particularly vulnerable to the birds as they face a real risk of physical injury if chased by a turkey. \\xa0 Concern is growing over potential car collisions due to turkeys wandering on roads, and the property damage they cause is starting to extend beyond gardens. In a recent interview with Sacramento news station KCRA 3, a Davis resident noted that the turkeys had scratched his car. The turkey saga may soon come to an end \\u2014 or lose steam at the very least. Two weeks ago, the Davis City Council voted 4-1 to revamp the city\\'s Wild Turkey Management Plan. In addition to implement initiatives to educate residents about scaring off wild turkeys and a \"no-feeding\" ordinance, the city will begin to euthanize particularly aggressive turkeys and attempt to relocate approximately half of the remaining population \\u2014 bad news for Downtown Tom. \\xa0': 116,\n",
       " u' Don\\'t be left in the dark now that Daylight Savings Time has ended It is 4:45 in the afternoon, and the sun is already setting. With the ending of Daylight Savings Time on Nov. 6, nighttime has been extended from 10 hours to roughly 14 hours as the winter season approaches. Why is this change significant to Davis? The answer is not hard to find and lies just about anywhere you turn: bikes.  As a quick reminder, the California Vehicle Code Section 21201 states that all bicycles should be equipped with a white light that illuminates a distance of 300 feet in front and on the sides of the bicycle. A red reflector must be visible from the rear. White or yellow reflectors must be visible from the pedals or the bicyclist\\'s foot gear. Reflectors must also be visible from the sides of the bicycle \\u2014 white or yellow on the front tire and a red or white reflector on the back tire.  It\\'s important to keep these measures in mind, as they ensure that the cyclist is the most visible when there is hardly any light on the roads.  Davis neighborhoods contain certain hazards themselves despite the number of bike paths available. Some neighborhoods lack street lights which make objects such as piles of leaves difficult to see on bike lanes. Drivers can also be unaware of oncoming cyclists and unintentionally open their car doors, causing cyclists to run into the door of the vehicle.  Of course, having bike lights can prevent some of these incidents from occurring. Bob Bowen, public relations manager and U.S. Bicycling Hall of Fame president, knows the importance of bike safety after years of cycling experience.  \"Safety is paramount,\" Bowen said. \"Sometimes folks that don\\'t have a lot of experience riding bikes, or even those who do, feel that it won\\'t happen to them. Unfortunately people, especially in the dark, may be distracted; they may be checking their texts illegally, they may be looking down, may be in the dark the cyclist doesn\\'t have a reflector or reflectorized clothing. For whatever reason, if you have a bike versus automobile collision, the cyclist is going to be the one that suffers the most.\"  Although Unitrans offers transportation year-round, many students still prefer their two-wheeled form of transportation despite the lack of sunlight and the wet weather. Bowen advises purchasing the brightest bike one can afford.  \"If you are going on a bike path that has little lighting, you want something that is going to be able to illuminate the path in front of you if you are on an illuminated street you want the lamp to be on a flashing mode so you can call attention to yourself and people can see you coming,\" Bowen said. Bowen said that if there is concern over getting bike lights stolen, removable bike lights are always an alternative option, which can be stored away when not in use.  In addition to bike lights, there are other procedures that cyclists can take for safer riding during these darker months. Bowen suggested bikers wear light-colored clothing or reflectorized clothing, attach reflectors to backpacks or anything that the cyclists might be wearing and also wear a helmet.  \"Do not take the right of way, even if it is yours, because some people may not be paying attention, and don\\'t drive out in front of people assuming they are watching because they may not,\" Bowen said.   Fewer hours of daylight should not get in the way of enjoying the countless miles of bike paths that Davis offers. Biking with bright lighting will protect both students\\' wallets from a fine and the health of students in general. ': 106,\n",
       " u' Douglas L. Waterman publishes \\'It Only Hurts When I Sit Down: A Bicycle Adventure on Historic Route 66\\' On Jan. 20, Davis resident Douglas L. Waterman presented his book \"It Only Hurts When I Sit Down: A Bicycle Adventure on Historic Route 66\" to a large crowd at The Avid Reader. Waterman, 66, is recently retired, and he rode all 2,300 miles of Route 66 on a bicycle in just 30 days. \"This was a memorable experience,\" Waterman said during his presentation. \"It was frightening, it was sad in some places, it was educational and it was even funny.\" Waterman said that his journey included many bottles of anti-chafing ointment, dangerous highways, a semi-truck tire exploding next to him as he rode and a run-in with Chicago state troopers amongst other things. As soon as Waterman returned to Davis, he began to write about his adventure. Throughout the process, he made use of several resources available to authors in Davis. Waterman said that writing became a major part of his life a decade ago, when he received writing mentoring from the local Davis Arts Center. \"About ten years ago, I decided I wanted to learn how to be a writer,\" Waterman said. \"So, the first thing I did was I joined the art center writing club.\" When Waterman\\'s manuscript was ready for publishing, he took it to local book publisher EditPros. EditPros, located on F Street and staffed by long-time Davis residents Marti Childs and Jeff March, provides traditional publishing services and, for authors like Waterman who prefer to self-publish, editing and publicity services. \"We initially started as a writing and editing business and eventually, in 2011, we got into book publishing [ ],\" Childs said. \"For the Route 66 book we helped them go through everything, get their ISBNs, helped them get their book signing at the Avid Reader.\" March explained that bookselling is incredibly competitive and that publicity is the hardest part of the process. \"Having a good network and working that network to the greatest degree that you can is really, really important,\" March said. For Waterman\\'s book, part of the publicity push was his book presentation at The Avid Reader. The Avid Reader hosts about 100 book-related events every year, both on-site at their store and off-site at locations such as libraries and schools. Alzada Knickerbocker, owner of The Avid Reader, said that she tries to support local talent through The Avid Reader\\'s events as much as possible. \"I\\'m very predisposed to local authors,\" Knickerbocker said. Waterman\\'s legendary bicycle ride is enough to make any Davis-ite proud, and his journey to becoming a published writer shows that, through all the resources available to writers, Davis is a supportive town for aspiring authors.': 71,\n",
       " u' Downtown Davis offers a wide range of Thai cuisine Sweet, salty, sour and spicy. Thai food has it all. Although Thai cuisine centers around these four main flavors, it offers an endless range of dishes. With curries, salads, noodle plates and rice, Thai food can be go from sweet to brutally spicy. This is especially true for local Thai establishments. Downtown Davis features six Thai restaurants and a Thai market. Peter Sriboonreuang, manager of Thai Canteen on Second Street, could not provide an answer as to why there are a multitude Thai restaurants in town. \"There [are] so many, I honestly don\\'t know. Thai food just does well in Davis,\" Sriboonreuang said.

The restaurant, formerly on Second Street, opened for business in 1998. At the time, it was one of only two Thai restaurants in town. During its 18-year run, Thai Recipes was popular with local Davis families. It offered a peaceful environment and focused on quality and authenticity of food. \"We use all the fresh ingredients [ ] Mostly, it has to be prepped fresh [ ] We try to make it authentic the best we can,\" Saicheur said. \"Even though maybe it\\'s not the same as we have in Thailand, we try to use the most close to the thing that we use [ ] We try not to put things that is not really Thai. We don\\'t try to change it, and I think the customers appreciate what we do here.\" Although Thai Recipes closed over winter break, Thai food remains readily available in Davis. From the quiet Thai Nakorn to the lively KetMoRee Restaurant and Bar, Thai restaurants in Davis range from small, family-friendly establishments to large, late-night hangouts with live music and alcohol. Jessica Walters, a UC San Diego student visiting Davis and dining at Thai Recipes, said she likes Thai food for its comfort and simplicity. \"I like that it\\'s not as heavy as Chinese food but still [heavy enough to be] comfort food. I like the herbs \\u2014 the Thai basil, cilantro, and spices are appealing. I like the fresh veggies [ ] They have Phanaeng, it\\'s this peanut curry. They use coconut milk, which I\\'m a fan of. The ingredients are simple, but it\\'s still a filling and substantial comfort food,\" Walters said. Sriboonreuang likes Thai food for its endless possibilities. \"You can play with Thai food. There\\'s definitely no limits when it comes to Thai food [ ] It\\'s just all the flavors. You get sweet, savory, salty, sometimes bitter. Being able to mix those together, they kind of compliment each other. Also with Thai food, it\\'s vegan friendly,\" Sriboonreuang said. Crunchy peanuts, savory meat, fresh vegetables, creamy sauces and chewy noodles \\u2014 whatever one is in the mood for, Davis Thai restaurants have it. The next time a round of midterms leaves students battered and in need of comfort food, head downtown and try some Thai. \\xa0': 86,\n",
       " u' ERIC FREDERICKS [CC BY-SA 2.0] / FLICKRA resurgence of the streetcar systems The Sacramento Streetcar project has become official after much debate about Sacramento public transportation. The City of Sacramento had a streetcar system decades ago, but was taken out by competition with the development of more automobiles and big oil companies. The proposal called for a $200 million streetcar line, which would span 3.3 miles, running between Sacramento and West Sacramento. This project has been underway for over 10 years, and is being finalized within the next few years. \"I think we\\'re at a tipping point now where people are recognizing the benefit of living closer to the central city and recognizing that it\\'s beneficial to have more transportation options that don\\'t require them all to have a single occupancy vehicle, especially when you\\'re talking about shorter trips between home and work, home and entertainment, things like that,\" said Fedolia Harris, a City of Sacramento Streetcar Project member. \"A system like a streetcar is perfectly suited for those kinds of trips.\" The environmental review and preliminary designs have been completed, and members are now waiting to finalize some of the details of the financial plan. Once the federal government makes its final decision on a large portion of the funding\\u2014 about 50 percent \\u2014 the project will continue to progress. If the final approval is given this year, it will take approximately seven or eight years to complete. \"If all goes well, we want the system to be under construction in 2018 and open to the public in late 2020/early 2021,\" Harris said. The Downtown/Riverfront Streetcar Project has been seeking funding through the Federal Transit Administration. When the project organization first applied for it, the maximum possible amount to receive was $75 million. The Obama administration agreed that the streetcar project was beneficial and that $75 million should be set aside.  The program then changed and maximum set allowance went from $75 million to $100 million, so the streetcar project was given additional components and is now waiting for the federal government to react to the $100 million proposal. Additional money is coming from the City of Sacramento, the City of West Sacramento, the State of California and the county of Sacramento. \"I think it\\'s going to be awesome,\" Harris said. \"We refer to the streetcar as a pedestrian accelerator \\u2014 it goes to all those places that you could technically walk to, but if you\\'re really trying to enjoy yourself, getting there a little bit faster, really comes in handy. It connects the two cities across the river, which effectively expands our downtown into [ ] West Sacramento.\" The streetcar line will potentially connect three major sports facilities, including Raley Field, home of the Sacramento River Cats baseball team, a new Downtown Sports and Entertainment Center and the Golden 1 Center for the Sacramento Kings. \"What the streetcar system is is a connector system, so it connects you between various types of existing public transit systems,\" said Mike Luken, the Port and Transportation manager for the city of West Sacramento. \"It provides a connection between downtown West Sacramento to downtown Sacramento, and it also provides great economic development benefits to promote redevelopment of both riverfronts and downtown Sacramento.\" The streetcar line will also connect major parts of the city, including Midtown, the Washington District, the Downtown Plaza, the old Sacramento Historic District and the Sacramento Convention Center. In addition to providing a major mode of transportation throughout the cities of Sacramento and West Sacramento, the streetcar system comes with major economic benefits. Many storefronts that are expected to open up along the line will have high value, since they will be common and easily accessible destinations.  \"I think it\\'s a nice asset to have and we also believe that we\\'ll have pretty substantial financial benefits for the property owners, as well as the city within close proximity to the line,\" Harris said. \"It\\'s a great transportation component, it\\'s a great economic benefit component, just all around the type of system that the city of Sac stature should have.\" The streetcar is also very environmentally friendly; it will reduce both traffic and carbon dioxide emissions from single-occupancy vehicles. Although the project is only in its early stages, there are hopes of expanding it down the line by providing additional tracks to connect the south over the proposed Broadway Bridge into the Broadway area. \"Projects and other development is proposed in association with a streetcar line because it\\'s a permanent investment in the public center and private sector into an area and it spurs additional development around it,\" Luken said. \"So when you look at the city of Portland, or the city of Seattle, or other places that have put in street cars, you essentially see hundreds of millions of dollars of additional investments in those areas directly related to the investment in the streetcar, with a permanent infrastructure improvement in those areas.\" The addition of the Downtown/Riverfront Streetcar Project running between Sacramento and West Sacramento will add to the resurgence of streetcars across the country, and provide the public with economically friendly transportation.': 74,\n",
       " u' Election results are in; Davis community concerned for what the future holds As Election Day came to a close, and the results trickled in, it proved a difficult time for many as Americans worried about the next president and the future of the country. As the night progressed, some people rejoiced at the results of this year\\'s election, while many heads hung in sorrow. By the end of the night, the United States elected a Republican-controlled Senate, a Republican-controlled House of Representatives and a Republican-controlled White House. As residents in a progressive state, many Californians and UC Davis students felt shock and terror regarding the choices the nation had made. While students and residents ran to the streets in protest of Donald J. Trump\\'s presidential victory on Nov. 8, Davis mayor Robb Davis extended his hand and listened to the concerns of many people downtown, who felt fearful and concerned about the safety of certain groups of people. \"This is a time that we as a city need to come together and say what it is we value in each other,\" Davis said. \"We need to make commitments to each other and discuss how we are going to deal with vulnerable populations, people who are legitimately experiencing fear. We need to decide how we are going to be as people to counter to exclusion and hate that has been so much part of the campaign.\" Irene Ezran, a third-year Spanish and International Relations major, supports students\\' rights to protest against Trump\\'s presidency.  \"Had the opposition been a respectful candidate, I wouldn\\'t have been in favor of protesting so much, and instead I would have encouraged moving forward as a country,\" Ezran said. \"Given the fact that Clinton won the popular vote, and Trump\\'s rhetoric is offensive to millions of Americans, particularly immigrants, Muslims, women and disabled people, as students we have the right and duty to show that we do not stand by his values of hatred and intolerance.\" While the headline of this election was the race for presidency between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, there were also many regional measures for Californians to vote on: Prop. 51 (Passed): Allows California to sell up to $9 billion in bonds ($7 billion going toward K-12 schools and the remaining $2 billion for community colleges) for the construction and modernization of school facilities. This results in a cost of approximately $17.6 billion (initial cost of $9 billion in addition to $8.6 billion in interest). Prop. 52 (Passed): Indefinitely extends an existing statute imposing fees on private hospitals to fund Medi-Cal, care for uninsured patients, children\\'s health coverage, and provide grants to public hospitals. This creates little fiscal impact on the state and taxpaying individuals.  Prop. 53 (Failed): If passed, it would have required statewide voter approval for revenue bonds to be issued or sold for any project costing over $2 billion if funded, owned, or managed by the state; however, this measure failed so state revenue bonds may continue to be provided without voter approval.  Prop. 54 (Passed): Any bill or amendments to a bill must be posted on the Internet for a minimum of 72 hours before the Legislature can pass it. In addition, the legislature must also record their proceedings and post it on the Internet for public viewing. The fiscal ramification of this proposition results in a one-time $1 to $2 million cost, in addition to an annual cost of about $1 million for video and recording.  Prop. 55 (Passed): Enacted in 2012 (until 2018), this measure extends the increased income tax on earnings over $250,000 until 2030. The allocated funds will support K-12 schools, community colleges, and healthcare. Results in an approximate $4 to $9 billion in annual state revenue from 2019 to 2030.  Prop. 56 (Passed): Increases the state excise tax on cigarettes by $2 per pack. The tax rises from 87 cents to $2.87 on cigarette packs with e-cigarettes and other tobacco products increasing in similar amounts. This tax will go towards funding health care for low-income Californians. Prop. 57 (Passed): Allows certain state prison inmates parole consideration if convicted of nonviolent felony offenses. In addition, the prison system can award sentencing credit to inmates for good behavior, rehabilitation or education. Moreover, juveniles are required to appear in juvenile court before being transferred to adult court. This relieves the state of about tens of millions of dollars annually and produces net county costs of about a few million dollars annually. Prop. 58 (Passed): Allows public schools to more easily choose how to teach English efficiently for non-native speakers, whether in English-only, in dual-language immersion or in other types of programs. It also continues to require that public schools ensure students are proficient in English. There is no notable fiscal impact on the state or schools.  Prop. 59 (Passed): As an advisory measure, this proposition does not require any action by state or federal legislature, but asks elected officials to overturn the Supreme Court\\'s decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. This case ruled that it was unconstitutional to place political spending limits on corporations and unions. This asks the legislature to increase regulation on campaign spending and contributions. This presents no direct cost to state or local governments. Prop. 60 (Failed): If passed, this proposition would have required adult film performers to use condoms during the filming of sexual intercourse and requires producers to pay for vaccines, tests, and medical exams with additional ways of enforcing those requirements. Not passing this measure means that adult film productions would continue to be subject to state and local workplace health and safety requirements.  Prop. 61 (Failed): Passing this measure would have prohibited state agencies from paying more for prescription drugs than the lowest price paid for the drug by the United States Department of Veteran Affairs. Its failure allows state agencies to continue to negotiate prices of drugs without reference to the prices paid by the Department of Veteran Affairs. Prop. 62 (Failed): Passage would have repealed the death penalty and replaced it with life imprisonment without the possibility of parole; however, its failure continues the death penalty sentence. Prop. 63 (Passed): Initiates new requirements for selling or purchasing ammunition, including a background check and approval from the Department of Justice. It also prohibits possession of large-capacity magazines and calls for the creation of a new court process for the removal of firearms from prohibited persons after being convicted of certain crimes. This increases the court law enforcement costs of California and its local governments by potentially tens of millions of dollars annually. Prop. 64 (Passed): Legalizes marijuana for recreational use, possession and cultivation by adults 21 and older, and imposes state taxes on the sale and cultivation of cannabis. It allows for regulation of non medical marijuana business by local governments and imposes standards for marijuana products. The revenue will fund youth programs, environmental protection, and law enforcement.  Prop. 65 (Failed): If passed, this would have redirected the money collected from the sale of carryout bags to environmental projects. Its failure imposes that charges on carryout bags could fund any purpose.  Prop. 66 (Passed): Changes court procedures for legal challenges to death sentence, including limiting successive petitions, increasing available attorneys for appeals and setting time limits on challenges. The fiscal impact of this measure in unknown.  Prop. 67 (Passed): This proposition prohibits most stores from providing single-use plastic carryout bags and instead requires a 10 cent charge for any other carryout bags. The estimated cost of this measure in unknown but relatively small.  \\xa0': 111,\n",
       " u' Events to promote safe sex On Feb. 1, Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) launched its \"Are You Sexcessful Campaign\" to raise awareness about physically and emotionally safe sex. The campaign will run various events on campus through Feb. 14. \"The Sexcessful Campaign is launched every February with a focus to promote healthy sexual communication and raises awareness about the different components of sexcess on campus,\" said Emilia Aguirre, sexual and mental wellness health educator and organizer of the campaign. \"This year our campaign involves not only social media marketing on Facebook and Instagram, but also pushed messaging through the UC Davis official Snapchat story reaching over 2,380 student views.\" Many of the events focus on empowering individuals\\' sexual choices and providing resources for safe and protected sex. SHCS\\'s Love Lab hosted a consent tabling event at the Student Community Center (SCC) the day after the campaign launched. The event provided pamphlets that gave tips on how to be sexcessful along with free safe sex products that can be found year-round at the SHCS Love Lab. At the event, JB Del Rosario, a fourth-year microbiology major, explained that events like the consent tabling are important for educating people who come from all backgrounds of sexual knowledge. \"The reason I\\'m part of [ ] the Sexcessful Campaign is that a lot of people come from different backgrounds and different knowledge of sexual education and sexual health,\" Del Rosario said. \"The main reason I\\'m involved is to help spread awareness about healthy communication between partners, STI transmission and safer sex resources.\" Upcoming events include a Feb. 9 Love Lab visit to the Segundo DC for students to pick up safe sex products such as internal and external condoms and dental dams. On Feb. 10, the SHCS will host Healthy Relationship Bingo at the SCC to discuss the differences between healthy and unhealthy relationships in a game of Bingo. The final event of the program will occur on Feb. 14, and will be a Safe Sex Talk hosted at the Women\\'s Research and Resource Center. This will provide students a safe place to discuss aspects of safe sex ad provide tips on how to be sexcessful. According to Chloe Tsudama, a fourth-year psychology major, these events and the campaign will work to engage students on what consent means and provide a safe environment to learn about their sexual health and options.': 14,\n",
       " u' Executive order has immediate consequences for UC Davis community President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 27, effective for 90 days, to impose a blanket restriction on the entry of permanent residents and immigrants to the United States with visas from seven Muslim-majority countries: Libya, Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan. In addition to this, the order puts an indefinite halt on the entry of Syrian refugees into the United States. On Feb. 3 the ban was temporarily halted by Judge James L. Robert of the state of Washington. In conjunction, the U.S. Department of State ordered a reverse on the cancellation of visas revoked in the past two weeks, \"so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled,\" according to a CNN news report. 60,000 visas were cancelled.  \"I am particularly concerned about the denial of free passage to those with valid visas,\" said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter in his statement to the campus community. \"This situation touches us closely.\"  So far the executive order has affected a number of UC Davis community members, including UC Davis physics professor Mohammad H. Hamidian. While Hamidian possesses dual Iranian-Canadian citizenship, if the ban is reinstated, he will be forbidden from entering the U.S. if he leaves. As a result of this uncertainty, he was forced to cancel plans to attend an academic conference in the Netherlands this month.  \"There seems to be some ambiguity as to whether I\\'d be allowed to return,\" Hamidian said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee. \"UC Davis has 87 students or scholars from Iran, Iraq and Libya, with unknown numbers of Iranian faculty, family members and workers with permanent residency living in our City,\" said Davis Mayor Robb Davis in his message to the community.  He went on to list numerous cases of international students and scholars who face severe personal and academic consequences because of the order.  Among these, the mayor mentioned an international Ph.D. student who recently obtained his student visa to attend UC Davis in the spring and must now deal with the jeopardized validity of his visa. He also wrote about an international student applying for a master\\'s program in the UC Davis Department of Engineering, who is now uncertain about whether she should continue working on her application. On Jan. 29, in the midst of all the protests, UC Davis law students and faculty of the Immigration Law Clinic rushed to the San Francisco International Airport to offer their services to passengers threatened by deportation, as well as families concerned for their detained relatives. In an interview with ABC News, Sara Ehsani-nia, a second-year UC Davis law student, explained how she worked with the Asian Law Caucus to help release an elderly Iranian couple that was in detention for three days. Several UC Davis faculty and alumni were also preparing to advocate for the detained by accumulating information on their constitutional rights. \"There are people in the community who have lost immediate family members and couldn\\'t attend their funerals because they have to decide between career development and academics versus their obligations to their family members back home,\" said Ellie White, a second-year graduate student in the Department of Civil Engineering.  An anonymous student with a multiple-entry student visa explained how they used to be able to travel out of the country and return easily, but now \"there is no clarification regarding that and I believe that no one should ever have to make a choice between their career and family.\" The anonymous student also said that \"there are a lot of conferences around the world that we cannot join, because we cannot come back. It used to be the case that you can apply for a new visa as a student or faculty, but for the past week you know that applying for a visa is not an option. Having the option to pack and travel if you needed to is something that can make a huge difference.\" According to White, the ban will also impact the U.S. as a whole. \"Putting this [in] a broader context of what it means for the United States: the effects of this ban will not be readily apparently right now,\" White said. \"Iran has been known to be dealing with a brain drain and I think now the U.S. is [ ] dealing with something similar. We\\'ve heard about a lot of people wanting to move to Canada or finishing their studies elsewhere. These people are productive members of society that are contributing to America and its economy and I feel like this ban is alienating them. There are the personal hardships it\\'s causing, but it\\'s also having broader impacts.\" The UC Office of the President, the chancellors of the 10 campuses, Interim Chancellor Hexter and Mayor Davis have all released statements expressing their care and concern for the members of the community from each of the seven nations.': 4,\n",
       " u' Executive: Josh Dalavai and Adilla Jamaludin In order to follow through with their winter 2016 senatorial platforms into a new term, Josh Dalavai, a third-year political science major, and Adilla Jamaludin, a third-year international agricultural development major, have decided to run on the Based slate executive ticket for the 2017 winter elections.  \"I think the way that this [partnership] came about was that we both realized [ ] that we had a good enough experience pool and similar goals to [ try] this at the next level,\" Dalavai said. \"It helps that we\\'re really good friends, too.\"  If elected as president and vice president, Dalavai and Jamaludin plan to address issues specific to students by maintaining UC Davis\\' status as a \"sanctuary\" campus, conducting more efficient student engagement, providing adequate lighting in dim areas of campus and incorporating resources for housing and food security. \"It\\'s a comprehensive effort, and ASUCD is in a good position to be in contact with all these different groups,\" Jamaludin said. \"We really want to take a strong stance about [the sanctuary campus status]. We are aware we are not the only students who care about this issue.\"  Through their partnership, the two plan to work as a team to achieve what the campus wants to see from its student government, since nothing is a \"one person show.\" \"With every project [ ] there\\'s always already someone working on it or someone who\\'s had the idea but just didn\\'t know how to do it, so we definitely incorporate student input and the voices of students past and voices of students current in everything that we do,\" Dalavai said. \"Whenever you do public service, it\\'s collaborative [ ] inherently so.\" \\xa0 Sam Chiang If elected for her second term, Sam Chiang, a third-year English major, hopes to continue her work on the issues she has shown passion for during her time in Senate thus far.  \"A lot of my platforms [ ] have similar themes [as last winter], but obviously they\\'re different projects,\" Chiang said. \"The things I care about haven\\'t changed really, if anything I just care more now.\" Basing her platforms on mental health awareness, cultural competency, international student accommodations and disability rights advocacy and outreach, one of the things Chiang hopes to establish is a mental health awareness month that represents many communities on campus and their needs. \"I think people do care about the work we can do and we can help their communities, so by going to the communities and helping them put on the events that they want to put on in mental health can be very powerful,\" Chiang said. \"We need to be more in touch with our communities [ and] it\\'s things like that that make us better representatives.\"  \\xa0 Khadeja Ibrahim Khadeja Ibrahim, a third-year political science major, has served as a staffer for former ASUCD senator and current vice presidential candidate Adilla Jamaludin. One of her main goals as a senator would be to create a minority leadership program. \"It\\'s a program I want to create specifically for minority students on campus that would provide them with resources and assistance so that they could pursue government careers in the future,\" Ibrahim said. \"[ ] The reason I want to create something like this is because I don\\'t think there\\'s anything like it on campus at the moment and I\\'d like to see more minority representation in local and national government, and I think that starts on college campuses.\" Ibrahim\\'s other main platform focuses around mental health. She hopes to help students increase their amounts of sleep by expanding nap areas available on campus and doubling the number of hammocks on the Quad. \\xa0 Bespoke Rosy Martinez Third-year human development major Rosy Martinez\\'s senate campaign platforms are founded from her experience as the external director at the ASUCD Pantry. She has plans to address food insecurity and student homelessness, promote higher administrative accountability and improve financial aid services.  \"Currently, the [financial aid office\\'s] hours are [ ] sort of impossible for the working student to have any access [to],\" Martinez said. \"I\\'d like to extend those hours [ ] and also have a liaison there [ ] so students have someone they can talk to and [ to] be the mediator between the financial aid person and the [student] themselves.\" As a co-founder of the slate \"Bespoke,\" Martinez would focus her time in Senate on those in need across the UC Davis campus. \"[As a slate] we\\'re trying to sort of drift away from the high political [ ] reigns of things and have a community orientation,\" Martinez said. \"We wanted to be more than a slate and more of an organization.\" \\xa0 Marcos Ismael Rodriguez Marcos Ismael Rodriguez, a second-year political science public service major, decided to run for Senate in this quarter\\'s election after staffing for a number of its members, including Kamal Thomas, Ricardo Martinez and then-senator Alex Lee.  \"I joined [ASUCD] the first quarter of my first year here,\" Rodriguez said. \"I [have also] joined the business and finance commission of ASUCD and [ ] I\\'ve been the vice-chair for about a year now.\" If elected on the Bespoke slate, Rodriguez would like to create more opportunities for \\xa0different campus communities to \"include their voice in student government.\" In addition to the issues of ASUCD transparency and becoming a representative for the ChiLat community in his position in senate, one of Rodriguez\\'s passions is to expand the Housing Advising for Undergraduate Students unit (HAUS). \"I plan [to ] help [HAUS] create housing advisors, which is what their original purpose was supposed to be, as well as expand Housing Day and make more accessible tools for students to know renter\\'s rights,\" Rodriguez said. \"In light of the housing crisis, some property managers might want to take abuse to that.\" \\xa0 Rahi Suryawanshi Rahi Suryawanshi, a third-year international relations major with an emphasis in environmental policy, spent

Startup Hub I have seen [ ] peoples ideas slowly turning into reality, [ and with #Include,] I\\'ve seen people [who] have already created their ideas,\" Suryawanshi said. \"I see the determination and diligence and also the business mind that you need to achieve initiatives. \" If elected, Suryawanshi will work to provide UC Davis with free self defense workshops, an online forum for research opportunities and allyship workshops in the residence halls \\u2014 all based on the idea of community and student government communication. \"As an international student, [ ] I have lived and seen the importances of people of different ethnicities living together,\" Suryawanshi said. \"That is fairly important to my core, and I think it\\'s important [ ] for all kinds of students to learn what communities they live amongst and how they can support these communities when the time comes.\" \\xa0 Yajaira Ramirez Sigala Yajaira Ramirez Sigala, a second-year sustainable agriculture food systems and Chicana/o studies double major, wants to utilize her experience helping in the AB540 Undocumented Student Center as an ASUCD senator.  \"I want to make sure that the undocumented community is being included in these dialogues that are happening on campus, and [ ] that there is somebody facilitating those conversations when talking about the undocumented experience,\" Ramirez Sigala said. \"We don\\'t want that narrative to be taken over by another person that might not necessarily be undocumented.\" Ramirez Sigala\\'s campaign platforms focus on the inclusive conversations on campus regarding underrepresented groups, including mandatory sensibility trainings across campus, safe-zone commissions and awareness for the undocumented community.  \"[This] would mean collaborating with other departments on campus and letting them know about the experiences that other underrepresented communities have faced before coming to Davis so that there can be a more positive student experience on campus,\" Ramirez Sigala said. \"[We have to] make it more inclusive with letting them know of the other experiences that students might come [with].\" \\xa0 Independent Executive:

Cheema also hopes to expand career and sexual assault prevention resources for students, ensure that students receive 10 free scantrons per year and increase the amount of hammocks on campus. \\xa0 Samir Himes If elected, Samir Himes, a second-year economics major, hopes to increase funding for ASUCD\\'s Entertainment Council so that more performance artists can come to UC Davis.  \"A lot of other big schools have events [ ] I think that\\'s something the student body really wants,\" Himes said. \"I know tons of people who go out of town each weekend to go to shows and I think that\\'s a loss to the UC Davis community.\" Himes also intends to introduce legislation for transparency in the Club Finance Council (CFC) after some students had an issue with getting the CFC to fund security for the Milo Yiannapoulous event. \"Students were upset that their money was going to something they didn\\'t want it to and so I\\'m proposing that the CFC, before they give money to an event, [that] they have to make a public notice, which is similar to how a lot of city governments work,\" Himes said. Additionally, Himes wants to put plastic nubs on the bottom of the library\\'s chairs to decrease the loud noise that the chairs make when pushed in and pulled out. \\xa0 Michael Gofman First-year economics major Michael Gofman has centered his campaign around three platforms: sustainability, affordability and improvement of student-teacher relations.  \"I want to get all the [leaders of the] different environmental organizations on campus [ ] to sit down at the table together and to centralize the environmental movement at UC Davis, because we\\'re already one of the most sustainable universities in the world without being centralized, but if we centralize we can achieve much bigger projects and the leaders will see how vast their resources are in order to achieve different tasks,\" Gofman said. As part of his affordability platform, Gofman, who has helped write grants for the ASUCD Pantry, hopes to expand the program\\'s resources. \"I\\'m hoping to as a senator [ ] help them find more consistent and reliable outside donors and funds from various funding organizations and grants to make sure that whatever the ASUCD budget situation is, however much money they have, no student on campus is going hungry,\" Gofman said.  \\xa0 Zaki Shaheen As a transfer student, Zaki Shaheen, a third-year political science major, is looking for ways to ease the transition for transfer students coming to UC Davis.  \"I\\'m a transfer student, so a big platform of mine is working with the Transfer Re-entry Veteran Services Center to provide an increased amount of services to transfer students as well as [to] basically just give a better kind of information about what is available to them to better integrate them into the Davis community because it can be more difficult coming in later,\" Shaheen said. Shaheen\\'s also plans on working with the Office of Advocacy and Student Representation to maintain and improve sexual assault prevention resources. If elected, he hopes to be a representative for different minority groups on campus.  \"I\\'m including my phone number on my [campaign] flyers and everywhere because I guess a theme of what I\\'m trying to run under is that I want to be accessible to everyone,\" Shaheen said. \\xa0 Frank McGreal Frank McGreal, a second-year managerial economics major, drew largely on his experience as an orientation leader while creating his platforms.  \"I want to implement a seminar at the beginning of each quarter [ ] for any incoming students or anyone who wants to see them [to show] different resources that we offer on campus, different clubs and different communities that are available in order to make the transition from whatever previous institution that they were at to coming to UC Davis as seamless as possible,\" McGreal said.  McGreal also hopes to create a mentorship program that would collaborate with the City of Davis to match an undergraduate student with an underprivileged youth. \"[This] mentorship program [would] hopefully influence youth in our city to want to go to a higher [educational] institution one day,\" McGreal said.

The Yolo County Farm Bureau \\u2014 a local farmer advocacy organization \\u2014 provides political representation to Yolo County farmers. Gretchen Schauer, a UC Davis alumnus and the executive assistant at the Yolo County Farm Bureau, said that the organization supports farmers in any way it can. \"We are a nonprofit, non-government affiliated organization, and we represent Yolo county farmers however they need us to represent them,\" Schauer said. \"So, for example, if they see a need for road repair, something like that, we try to influence the county to help out with that.

This year it will hold its 103rd annual meeting at the Yolo County Fairgrounds on Jan. 19. \\xa0The theme of the meeting is \"adapting to thrive.\" The Farm Bureau will honor Heringer Estates Family Vineyards and Winery, a local winery in Clarksburg. Schauer said Heringer Estates is a great example of this year\\'s theme. \"A small committee decided that the theme of this annual meeting would be \\'adapting to thrive,\\' which seems to be the theme of agriculture nowadays,\" Schauer said. \"They thought that Heringer Estates is a good example of how agriculturalists have had to adapt to thrive, especially recently. Heringer Estates has been around for 140 years, which is remarkable.\"  Heringer Estates has been owned by the Heringer family, which includes several graduates of UC Davis, for six generations. In the past, the family has grown field and road crops. It was not until the 1970s that they began to grow grapes, and not until the early 2000s that the farm established a winery. Steve Heringer III said he enjoys the social aspect of winemaking. \"One of the nice things about the grape and wine industry, as opposed to anything else we have ever done, is everybody is interested in what we\\'re doing, how we\\'re doing it, how we\\'re making the wine,\" Heringer said. \"Wine is a very social agricultural product, and it opens up incredible opportunities to tell agricultural stories and our own personal story.\"  The story of Heringer Estates is one of constant change and adaptation. The 140-year history of the farm has not been without its challenges \\u2014 the decades have brought years of excessive rain, years of drought, market changes, industry changes and periods of high interest rates during the 1980s, to name a few. Heringer said that adaptation has been the key to the farm\\'s longevity. \"Just the ability to adapt to the situation, whether it\\'s weather, whether it\\'s finances, whether it\\'s crops, or whether it\\'s family,\" Heringer said. \"The ability to adapt to meet the challenges [ ] persistence, resiliency, a \\'never-say-die\\' attitude.\"  With regard to the honors that the family will receive at the Farm Bureau meeting, Heringer said the family is humbled. \"We are very, very humbled by the honor, and I will tell you, in my mind, we\\'re not doing anything that any other farmer doesn\\'t do if he\\'s going to survive, and that\\'s adapt to whatever the current situation or markets are,\" Heringer said. \\xa0': 82,\n",
       " u' Farmers overwhelming medical marijuana market causes \"land rush\" in Yolo County Yolo County supervisors voted on Oct. 11 to enact a moratorium prohibiting additional permit requests for cannabis cultivation due to the high volume of permits the county had already received. The board met again on Oct. 25 and voted 3-2 to continue the moratorium, pending additional considerations.  The moratorium was originally initiated for several reasons, including numerous requests for permits that engulfed the existing staff, concerns with cultivation sites near sensitive areas (such as schools and parks) and worries that demand for cultivation sites (for medical marijuana) would drive up land prices.  \"There was this sudden rush of interest in Yolo County that we really needed to put the brakes on,\" said John Young, Yolo County agriculture commissioner, according to CBS Sacramento. However, there was some opposition to this prohibition. Don Saylor, Yolo County supervisor, voted against the moratorium, citing the sudden prohibition as unreasonable. The deadline for applications ended on Oct. 11 at 5 p.m., only hours after the board voted to pass the moratorium. \"I know that there are some people [ ] hoping to establish legal cultivation sites who were in the process of meeting their requirements but had not yet fulfilled those exactly,\" Saylor said. \"It was an unfair thing to tell them that they cannot proceed. I thought we should make individual, case-by-case decisions whether someone was in the process and exercising due diligence for the requirement or if they were just coming late to the game.\" Before the moratorium can be removed, the council needs to make sure that the cultivation ordinance applies to all parties involved. They must also ensure that the county has the revenue to pay for regulation enforcement and application processing. However, this doesn\\'t seem to have stopped many countywide growers. The number of illegal growers, though still unknown, is estimated to be between 400 and 800. Illegal cannabis growing creates a challenge for the community and its leaders. \"[Growing cannabis without a permit] is illegal so it creates public-safety dangers, potential theft, environmental degradation through inappropriate use of water, redirecting creeks, [ ] using illegal pesticides and more,\" Saylor said. \"Then since it\\'s an illegal activity there may be a presence of firearms, large amounts of money, all those elements of an illegal operation. One of the things that I am interested in is moving away from the public-safety risks and the environmental hazards of illegal cultivation.\" Saylor hopes to move toward a regulatory framework, permitting the cultivation of cannabis under specified conditions, which in his view is a preferable approach to prohibition. The council will revisit the issue again on Nov. 22 with additional considerations, including the voter decision on Proposition 64, which could open up cannabis cultivation for non-medicinal use. Dennis Chambers, chief deputy agricultural commissioner, said that this \"land rush\" has also driven land values dramatically higher, possibly three times or more, but understands that some rural communities are wary of cannabis cultivators who might disrupt Yolo County culture. \"There is a fear that all cultivators are less than scrupulous and are not business people or they are just trying to turn a quick dollar,\" Chambers said. \"What we\\'ve found is that is not the case. By and large, these people are businessmen and want to do things right.\" \\xa0': 118,\n",
       " u' Feminist Research Institute nominates Linda Katehi for director position amid criticism Linda P.B. Katehi, the former UC Davis chancellor, turned down a nomination this past December for a position to lead the UC Davis Feminist Research Institute (FRI).  \"As I wrote to the Board of the Institute in my resignation letter, while I was honored by the nomination, I could not accept it due to the projects and related travel that I have committed myself to,\" Katehi said in a Facebook message. \"This year I am on a sabbatical leave, the first one in my 32 years as a faculty member (usually faculty go on a sabbatical leave for a year every seven years) and I am spending this time working with the National Academies in Washington DC on two separate reports and with the Association for the Advancement of Science also in DC as the President of their Engineering Section. In addition to these activities, I am working to develop a National Think Tank that will focus on Women\\'s Issues.\" The nomination, put forth by the institute\\'s board of directors, requested that Katehi be chosen as the new director for the FRI. Since then, many members of the UC Davis community have taken issue with the consideration of Katehi, who last August resigned after criticism of her decision to accept seats on the boards of private education companies and her spending of funds to remove negative publicity after the 2011 pepper spray incident.  Sarah Shemery, a fourth-year gender sexuality and women\\'s studies major and deputy director of the Office of Advocacy and Student Representation (OASR), said that, while Katehi\\'s work concerning women in STEM was admirable, her subsequent scandals were hard to ignore. \"People definitely try to argue that she\\'s done so much for women in STEM, and I\\'m sure she has,\" Shemery said. \"It\\'s important for women and femme-identified individuals to be in those spaces because those are spaces where you really don\\'t see a presence of people like that. At the same [time] it doesn\\'t cancel out, one, the pepper spraying incident. She should have been fired immediately after that. That doesn\\'t cancel out the unethical board positions. And that doesn\\'t cancel out any of Linda\\'s decisions that were inherently corrupt but ignored by everyone.\" The FRI was established in 2015 and focuses on how gender, sexuality, race and other social structures influence the research process, according to their website. The institute\\'s mission statements says that the \"FRI will generate transformative, paradigm-shifting linkages across disciplines by bringing feminist ethics and methodologies to bear on the basic sciences, social sciences, humanities, health sciences, engineering, law, economics and agriculture and environmental science.\"  In an interview with the Davis Enterprise, Katehi noted that she had not known about the nomination until after it had been submitted. While she is supportive of the institute, she told the Davis Enterprise that she is \"working on a think tank for women on a national level.\" Shaitaj Dhaliwal, a third-year international relations major and ASUCD senator, believes that feminism should be an inclusive movement. \"Katehi was a strong advocate for women\\'s needs and resources, particular for STEM fields,\" said Dhaliwal in an e-mail interview. \"She was successful considering UC Davis was most recently named the best university for women in STEM. However, being a leader on campus and advocating for women\\'s equality and respect, while simultaneously engaging in false practices as chancellor, sets us further back.\"\\n Dhaliwal said that women of color and transgender individuals deserve an equal level of advocacy and that there is more work to be done to make feminism inclusive for all women. Since the beginning of the 2016-17 school year, Katehi has continued to receive her chancellor\\'s salary of $424,360. Next year she will return to the university as an engineering professor. \"The topics of feminism in education and research and feminist research are important and require discussion and constructive debate,\" Katehi said. \"My views on these issues, informed by my education in engineering and my experience as a female engineer, faculty member and university administration, are broad and inclusive and are demanding the presence of an intellectual space which is progressive and innovative; progressive as defined by its ability to recognize systemic problems, and innovative as defined by its willingness to accept creative ideas and adopt unique methodologies from a broad spectrum of possible solutions.\" Meanwhile, Shemery stressed the need for intersectionality in feminism on campus. \"[A goal] that is inclusive, absolutely,\" Shemery said. \"One that kind of goes beyond [ ] white feminism and that really gives a platform to people of identities that really need it, people [ ] that are more marginalized and are more vulnerable on this campus. Those voices need to be heard, and yet they\\'re not.\" For Dhaliwal, her hope for women in education includes a need for encouragement and equal treatment. \"Women need to be empowered at a young age to pursue certain fields that are male-dominated,\" Dhaliwal said. \"Women should then go on to earn an equal pay and have equal job prospects as men. We cannot expect women to pursue fields that they won\\'t be respected in.\" \\xa0': 38,\n",
       " u' Former interim chief of nursing and patient care services becomes new chief Toby Marsh was appointed as the new chief of nursing and patient care services for the UC Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) on Dec. 14. He had served in the same role as the interim chief since April 1. Marsh oversees more than 1,800 nurses and nurse practitioners who together provide care for more than 200,000 patients every year at the 627 bed acute care hospital and affiliated primary and specialty care clinics. Ann Madden Rice, the chief executive office of UCDMC, believes that Marsh will continue to lead just as well as he had in his previous positions. \"[Marsh] has shown exemplary leadership throughout his career, and I am confident he will continue to do the same in this important role,\" Rice said in a UC Davis press release. In 2004, Marsh joined UCDMC as a registered nurse and was promoted successively to nursing advisor, nurse manager and director of patient care services. From 2010 to March 2016, he was director of hospital and clinics, planning and leading daily patient care procedures, clinical education and projects. While Marsh led the nursing department, UCDMC earned Magnet recognition from the American Nurses Credentialing Center in 2014. The designation is the nation\\'s highest form of recognition for nursing excellence and serves as a benchmark for quality of care. Some of Marsh\\'s personal distinctions include serving on the board of the California Association of Healthcare Leaders, working as \\xa0a fellow of the American College of Healthcare Executives, receiving the 40 Under 40 Award from the Sacramento Business Journal in 2012 and receiving U.S. Air Force Commendation Medals in 2001 and 2004. Marsh was a member of the U.S. Air Force from 1997 to 2004, and he considers his work as a healthcare worker to be heavily influenced by his time in the military. \"Robert Olson, my squadron commander, was my biggest professional influence,\" Marsh said in an interview for the Sacramento Bee. \"He role modeled how to treat people and how to work with people. His job \\u2014 and my job now \\u2014 is to help facilitate other people\\'s greatness, to help them achieve what they showed up to do. There, it was fixing planes. Here, it\\'s delivering safe, quality patient care.\" Baljeet Sangha, president of California Association of Healthcare Leaders, also recognized how Marsh\\'s military service has influenced his current healthcare leadership. \"Toby Marsh has a strong legacy of selfless, servant leadership,\" Sangha said. \"From his time in the military serving our country, to his bedside nursing career to his health administration leadership roles, Toby has focused on improving the professional development of his peers with their careers and modeled how we should keep the needs of those we serve at front of mind.\" Sangha regards Marsh as the best candidate for his appointment. \"He is humble, personable, approachable, humorous and compassionate,\" Sangha said. \"UC Davis could not have chosen a better chief of nursing and patient care services.\" \\xa0': 46,\n",
       " u' Former plans paused in light of Katehi\\'s resignation Prior to her resignation as UC Davis chancellor, Linda P.B. Katehi laid out tentative plans to extend UC Davis into Sacramento. The plans were brought to a halt during the chancellor search process. In 2014, Katehi had begun plans to integrate UC Davis into Sacramento and add campus buildings in the downtown Sacramento area. The expansion plans had failed to receive significant traction, and no physical drawings had been produced for the intended infrastructure. Katehi also lacked faculty support for the proposition, and the plans failed to be presented to the UC Board of Regents. Following Katehi\\'s resignation, the plans were ultimately dropped. However, University of California (UC) President Janet Napolitano announced on Jan. 4 that she would like the next chancellor to continue to pursue extending UC Davis into Sacramento in order to bring additional jobs and commerce to the area, and also to provide space to accommodate a growing campus.  \"I think there is a real opportunity to bring Davis over the highway, so to speak, and to do more in this general economic area of California,\" Napolitano said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee. \"What I am looking for in a chancellor is someone that has the capability of doing that.\" Proposed aspects of the extension include housing a World Food Center in the downtown railyard area. The center would be a satellite campus to attract top educators in food safety, agricultural policy and nutrition. The site would also include a medical center to focus on food-related illnesses such as diabetes and obesity. Additional plans included creating a political center similar to the UC Washington Center in D.C. for students to live, study and intern in the state Capitol. \"We will create the world\\'s preeminent center where scholars, policy experts, government officials, media and others come for research, guidance and direction on all food related issues as they pertain to our planet,\" Katehi said at a presentation to the UC Regents in July 2013. City officials also support the idea, noting that the standing railyard building could house a year-round farmer\\'s market, and the initiative could open up \"America\\'s Farm to Fork Capital\" to more agricultural and food related businesses.  Napolitano met with Sacramento mayor Darrell Steinberg in June following his election to discuss the possibility of UC Davis having a larger presence in the Sacramento area. Steinberg was receptive to the idea. \"We want to invite the university to come across the causeway, because whether it\\'s food policy research, entrepreneurship around food and agriculture, whether it\\'s literally bringing some of their graduate programs across the causeway to Sacramento, I think we can be of great benefit to the university and we need the university,\" Steinberg said in an interview with The Sacramento Bee. Katehi declined The California Aggie\\'s request for comment. \\xa0': 37,\n",

       " u' Funding to expand innovation, entrepreneurship infrastructure UC Davis received $2.2 million in state funding last month from Assembly Bill 2664. AB 2664, the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Expansion Bill, was designed to propel new innovation and entrepreneurship efforts across the University of California (UC) system through investments in infrastructure, incubators and entrepreneurship education programs. Each of the 10 UC campuses received $2.2 million in one-time funding. The bill was authored by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin (D-44) and was signed by Governor Jerry Brown in the fall of 2016.  \"The UC system is the gold standard for research and innovation,\" Irwin stated in a press release from the UC Office of the President. \"The bill\\'s funding will help convert UC research into products that benefit society. It will lead to startup businesses and local economic growth.\" The state\\'s investments will support programs that benefit campus innovators and entrepreneurs as well as local entrepreneurs. Each campus will execute long-term plans suited to the strengths and needs of that campus\\' local context. According to a statement on UC Davis Dateline, UC Davis\\' AB 2664 program focuses on three areas. The first is expansion of grant programs that will demonstrate commercial feasibility for technology developed at the university. The second area of expansion is business training and mentorship programs to build professional skills and practical experience pertaining to business and entrepreneurship. The final area is creating programs that will provide work and lab space, research and development equipment and support resources to entrepreneurs.  \"AB 2664 funding is important because it allows us to amplify, expand and sustain the success of our uniquely collaborative programs at UC Davis, which enable campus innovators and the entrepreneurial community to interact effectively for regional impact,\" said Dushyant Pathak, the associate vice chancellor of the Office of Research to UC Davis Dateline.  The program implementation will be managed by the UC Davis Office of Research, along with UC Davis\\' Venture Catalyst and the Mike and Renee Child Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at the UC Davis Graduate School of Management.  Cleveland Justice, the executive director for the Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship, believes the university will be able continue to support and substantially grow the commercialization of important research from UC Davis and the surrounding region. \"At UC Davis we have strengths in so many areas of important need \\u2014 food, agriculture, life sciences, engineering, medicine \\u2014 and this funding will help our world-class researchers take their ideas out of the lab and into the world,\" Justice said via email. \"With this funding we\\'ll greatly expand our work with undergraduate entrepreneurs, build out new areas of support for entrepreneurs throughout the Central Valley and we\\'ll further connect partners on campus and with other universities in the region.\" Research is a significant aspect of UC Davis\\' reputation. The campus attracts many students who want to conduct hands-on research in order to gain better knowledge and understanding of their fields. One such student is Stegi Ilanthiraian, a third-year microbiology major. \"I am a pre-med and I really wanted to understand research and its role in medicine,\" Ilanthiraian said. \"Davis is a research based school. There are so many resources and opportunities for undergrads because of the amount of professors who do research.\" AB 2664-funded programs will create opportunities in fields such as human health, agriculture, animal health and engineering. Funds will also be allocated to existing programs serving postdoctoral trainees, graduate students and the undergraduate community, according to UC Davis Dateline. ': 18,\n",
       " u' Grant from Sutter Health supports Davis Pathways in providing shelter for the homeless More long-term housing solutions are on their way for the City of Davis\\' homeless population, thanks to a $233,000 grant from Sutter Health.  131 people were recorded as homeless in Davis in January of 2015, according to the Homeless Point-in-Time study. However, many people believe that the study underestimates the number of sheltered and unsheltered homeless persons in Davis, seeing as it doesn\\'t account for those who are \"couch surfing,\" or staying temporarily in another person\\'s home. Additionally, the numbers are contingent-based on who responds to the survey and whether or not they are in Davis at the specific time of the survey.  The next count will take place on Jan. 23, and, if the numbers follow the current trend, the count is expected to increase. There are currently a number of resources available to the homeless for shelter. For nearly 10 years, the Interfaith Rotating Winter Shelter (IRWS) has provided emergency shelter for homeless persons during the months of November through March. Those in need of a warm and safe place to stay come in for a brief screening and are then sent to one of the local congregations hosting the shelter for the week. Once there, they are given a cot to sleep in and a warm meal. The next morning, transportation arrives at 6 a.m. and they are driven to designated drop-off locations around downtown. \"IRWS was founded to provide an emergency shelter,\" said Eric Elton, the IRWS board chair. \"It wasn\\'t founded to provide a need out of homelessness or to assist in any way other than to provide a place to stay for the night.\"  With help from the Sutter Health grant, the City of Davis will be able to further help the homeless through new federal policy directives, including Housing First. The Housing First \\xa0initiative aims to place homeless persons into permanent housing. It strays from the traditional \"transition\" approach to alleviating homelessness by striving to provide a stable shelter before addressing other issues.  \"The federal policy directive has been called Housing First, but it really basically says that the goal is to house homeless people first, and then put supporting services around that,\" said Joan Planell, the social services consultant of Yolo County\\'s Health and Human Services Agency. \"Sutter is giving money to add a job training program to the Pathways program, finance some rental assistance for people as a transition into permanent housing, and to do the supporting services around the individual once they\\'re placed in housing.\"  These supporting services range from a number of different methods to aid those receiving shelter. One example would be a case management service that would send a trained employee to the sheltered individual to make sure rent is being paid and the sheltered individual has food in their fridge. In addition, sheltered individuals have access to any mental health services they need.  Senate Bill 1380 declares California as a Housing First state as of Sept. 29, 2016. According to the bill, \"a state agency or department that funds, implements, or administers a state program that provides housing or housing-related services to people experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, except as specified, to revise or adopt guidelines and regulations to include enumerated Housing First policies\" would be required.  For Davis, this would mean that the efforts toward resolving homelessness, as well as those transitioning into living in a house and community, would be more successful.  \"The idea is that you don\\'t just take someone who\\'s been living in the streets and put them in a house and walk away,\" Planell said. \"The idea is to support them in that living arrangement so that it succeeds.\" \\xa0': 84,\n",
       " u' Helping the community through Davis Community Meals is Watermelon Music\\'s forte One thing that Davis certainly doesn\\'t have treble with is helping out the community. For the past 15 years, Watermelon Music, a local music store downtown, has held a strings-for-food drive, in which people can get a free set of D\\'Addario strings if they bring in at least two non-perishable food items, limited to two instruments per household.  This benefits Davis Community Meals, a non-profit, non-denominational volunteer organization that gives food to people in financial distress or those without homes. This year\\'s drive will be the last one held at Watermelon Music\\'s current location in downtown Davis.  Every year, the second Saturday in November is dedicated to this food drive, which aims to collect about 200 instruments \\u2014 this would mould mean at least 400 cans of food. In a four-hour time span, this 200-instrument goal has been achieved three times in the past.  Volunteers consist mainly of community members who are knowledgeable in restringing instruments. \"[It started] long ago, over 20 years ago, and there was a representative from a company that made strings, who wanted to give [out] free strings to promote their company,\" said Jeff Simons, manager of Watermelon Music. \"But we wanted to have it for a cause, so someone suggested doing a food drive.\" Simons is also a member of the Independent Music Store Owners [IMSO], an online forum that shares ideas pertaining to their storefronts. About five or six years ago, the group started talking about which promotions they did that were successful. Upon someone mentioning the strings-for-food drive, the group jumped on the idea, looking to do something of the sort on their own fronts as well. Although the minimum amount of non-perishable items per instrument is two, some people bring in shopping bags of food, the total amounting anywhere from 800 to 1,000 cans. Others decide to drop off food without even getting the free strings. \"The line goes out the door,\" said Adam Portocarrero, a Watermelon Music employee. Food pantries tend to run especially low approaching the colder months, so the food drive is a good way to replenish the stocks and get community members involved in \\xa0helping each other. Due to the rising costs of their current storefront, Watermelon Music is relocating to a bigger space on the intersection of Lake and Covell Boulevard, where there will be a live music performance venue inside in addition to a grand piano. However, the food drive will continue to happen every year. \"[We will] definitely [continue the food drive], it\\'s a big part of what we do,\" Simons said. \"Anytime you get a hundred musicians in a room, it\\'s cool. It\\'s a bonding kind of community thing. And at the same time, everyone is contributing. It\\'s not about getting free strings, it\\'s about helping out the community.\" Bill Pride, executive director of Davis Community Meals, explained that the organization serves around 165 to 175 meals per week by working with a soup kitchen staffed by high school or school group volunteers, in addition to partnering with food drives like Watermelon Music\\'s. Strings-for-food, however, is one of the larger food drives that Davis Community Meals is involved with, producing about six to seven large boxes filled to the brim with non-perishable items. \"The food drive is really great. It\\'s great to get re-stocking of food for various locations to help tie people over,\" Pride said. \"It\\'s always been an important thing to help people in our community.\" \\xa0': 108,\n",
       " u' Higher education leaders stand by undocumented students With the upcoming presidential inauguration on Jan. 20, leaders of the University of California (UC), California State University (CSU) and California Community College (CCC) have been pressing President-elect Donald Trump to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration policy for students involved in the program to be able to maintain their higher education in California. DACA was started under the Obama administration in June 2012 to allow undocumented minors who immigrated to the United States to request renewable protection from deportation. The protection lasts two years given that the individuals meet certain qualifications, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\\' website. Eligible \"Dreamers\" may acquire a work permit and go to school in the United States without being citizens. Trump has repeatedly mentioned his plans to end the program, which could put many Dreamers at risk of being deported, including students at UC Davis. In response, UC President Janet Napolitano, CSU Chancellor Timothy White and CCC Chancellor-designate Eloy Ortiz Oakley composed a letter to Trump on Nov. 29 explaining why it is essential for him to keep DACA intact. \"These sons and daughters of undocumented immigrants are as American as any other child across the nation, in all but in the letter of the law,\" the letter read. \"They should be able to pursue their dream of higher education without fear of being arrested, deported or rounded up for just trying to learn.\" Though it is not certain that DACA will be annulled, UC Davis administrators are prepared to protect students\\' right to pursue higher education. \"The University will continue to protect the privacy of student records and information, which are confidential under law,\" UC Spokesperson Claire Doan said in an e-mail. \"The Principles also establish a consistent system-wide policy that campus police departments will not act as adjunct immigration officers, [and] their focus will remain [on] student safety.\" Despite the UC\\'s plans to support these Dreamers, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 10 revealed the high possibility of Trump removing DACA, according to online magazine Salon Media Group. \"[DACA] would need to be studied, [but] it would certainly be constitutional, I believe, to end that order,\" Trump\\'s Attorney General nominee Senator Jeff Sessions said in the hearing. \"[The Department of Justice] would have no objection to a decision to abandon that order.\" Salon Media Group said that Sessions will potentially recommend that Trump end DACA, but Sessions did not mention the resulting arrangement for the 800,000 DACA-registered immigrants. However, Andrea Gaytan, director of the AB540 and Undocumented Student Center, said that repealing DACA would mean students could lose protection from deportation, opportunities to work legally, ability to travel for research purposes and, in some states, their driver\\'s licenses. Gaytan said students should be concerned for themselves, friends or loved ones who are currently involved with DACA.  \"We\\'re trying to make sure that [ ] students have access to legal information and know their rights,\" Gaytan said. \"[And] to make sure the greater campus community also knows how to support undocumented individuals.\"  Meanwhile, Gaytan reminds AB540 and undocumented students to stay focused in school and confide in the community of people here at UC Davis to help them, especially if they are afraid to share their immigration status. \"The center serves to provide a sense of consistency and normalcy,\" Gaytan said. \"We hope that students know there are people at this campus who care about them and want to help them, and that we have resources to try to make that happen.\" The future of these Dreamers will soon be in Trump\\'s hands when he is sworn into presidency on Inauguration Day. Until then, California higher education leaders will work to protect DACA students. DACA-status students who are currently traveling abroad are instructed to return to the United States before Jan. 20, as they may have difficulty entering the country afterwards. The AB540 and Undocumented Student Center urges DACA students to contact them immediately for legal help, if they have not done so already. \\xa0': 41,\n",
       " u' Huttle helps students receive career advice from professionals at Google, Amazon, Facebook Recent UC Davis graduate Chris Tung along with Michelle Masek from Arizona State University have created a website and app called Huttle, an online system that connects college students with recent graduates and working professionals in top businesses such as Google, Amazon and Facebook. Students on this site can seek career advice and ask any questions they have about potential career goals.  \"Huttle is a community for career help,\" Tung said. \"Huttlers can ask questions to our tight-knit community and get fast, personalized answers from successful professionals and peers who tackled similar career problems. Huttlers can also share links and advice they read on the internet to surface up content that other Huttlers might find helpful in their career journeys.\" According to U.S census data, 40 percent of the nation\\'s unemployed are millennials: 4.6 million young people out of work. The amount of millennials making less than $25,000 a year has also spiked significantly in recent years. Tung said that this is why Huttle was created: to give students access to honest, meaningful and personalized career advice to help them jumpstart their career journeys.  Tung and Masek were coworkers at Imgur, a popular website for image discovery. While discussing one day what they would do if money was not an issue, they both realized they were most fulfilled when helping other people with their careers. They then began researching and decided to create Huttle. The two are currently a small unit in Silicon Valley consisting only of themselves and two student interns from Sacramento State and Arizona State Universities.  Masek believes that Huttle has the ability to help and support students who do not have access to important networks by giving them the chance to expand their career knowledge and connections. Masek described Huttle as a \"supportive, mission driven [and] democratized\" company. Since its launch in August of last year, over 300 users have signed up across its three target universities \\u2014 UC Davis, Sacramento State and Arizona State University. The website has helped over 20 students and recent graduates with career questions and connections with companies like Google and Amazon.  On the site, new Huttle users are introduced to a feed of customized career topics most interesting to that user, plus some professionals the user might be interested in learning from. The main feed also consists of all the current posts on Huttle sorted by most popular. \"Your Feed\" is where the user is recommended posts based on other \"Huttlers\" and topics the user follows.

       " u' Increase in applications brings more diverse pool of students Of the 171,449 potential freshmen who applied to at least one of the University of California (UC) campuses this past November, UC Davis received 70,904 freshmen applicants, according to a press release. This is a 3.5 percent increase in the number of applicants from last year. There was also significant progress in diversity of the applicant pool, which included students from historically underserved groups and low-income families. \"This year\\'s applications affirm, once again, that Californians\\' demand for a UC education keeps getting stronger,\" UC President Janet Napolitano said in a press release. \"This is a testament to the excellence of California\\'s public research university and reinforces the imperative to continue working with our state government to preserve UC\\'s quality and affordability, and to ensure there is a place at the university for every deserving California student.\" Walter Robinson, the UC Davis associate vice chancellor for enrollment management, said the UC seeks to create accessible education for California students by admitting 2,500 residents in 2017. UC Davis is on track to uphold the UC goal, as 72.4 percent of this year\\'s applicants are California residents \\u2014 an increase of 4.2 percent since last year.  Robinson said that there has also been an increase in applications due to outreach and recruitment efforts in California and other areas. \"Everyone seems to understand the value proposition of a University of California [education],\" Robinson said. \"It would be irresponsible on our part, as a public institution especially, not to acknowledge which populations are struggling the most to keep up with the graduation and retention rates.\" The efforts toward recruitment have been successful, as the percentage of African American, American Indian and Chicano/Latino applicants have increased by 2.8, 2.2 and 7.5 percent, respectively. Through financial aid and resources such as the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP), the UC aspires to make their campuses more affordable to attend, especially for such underserved groups. \"I was nervous about applying to college because I knew it was very expensive,\" said Joel Gutierrez, a first-year marine and coastal science major. \"[The UC is] very considerate toward people and their incomes [and] they to want to make sure everyone has a good opportunity.\" The UC hopes to attract students who are first-generation college students, from low-income families or who are part of historically underserved groups. As it is the UC\\'s ongoing mission to admit a diverse pool of students, this year\\'s variety of applicants will help the campuses pursue that goal. \"Our hope is that with understanding diversity as value added, we will see a continued increase in diversity in all of its definition,\" Robinson said. Robinson mentioned that UC Davis considers students from all backgrounds and focuses on applicants who take advantage of the resources within their respective learning environments. \"We admit stories students tell us about themselves, and in doing so they give us an understanding of what each applicant could possibly bring to the intellectual, social and cultural vitality of the campus,\" Robinson said. \"[This] moment of introspection is probably the most mature thing a 17 or 18-year-old will ever be asked to do, [ ] so students have the opportunity to put their best [selves] forward.\" Gutierrez said that the UC application process in fall 2015 was highly competitive, so he concentrated on ways to stand out from the other applicants.': 49,\n",
       " u' Indoor facility will provide a cafeteria, classroom, collaborative space  Change is on its way to Davis Senior High School (DSHS) within the next 12 months. On Oct. 25, a ceremony was held in which students and school administrators alike broke ground for the construction of the brand new All Student Center.  Since 2010, the student body at Davis Senior High has lacked a proper cafeteria. The multipurpose room was shut down six years ago due to black mold and various problems. In 2013, the room was finally demolished. While an area outside remained for eating, students were left exposed to the elements. During periods of rain or extreme heat, those who didn\\'t have the means to leave the campus during lunch were left to eat in the hallways.  Students took notice and began to advocate for their peers, realizing the division among students. They wanted to have an all-inclusive area for students, which is where the name for the new facility was derived. After years of hard work and collaboration with teachers, counselors and the school board, the students are finally seeing their solution come to life. \"This has been the number one issue for students and staff, you know, not having a place to gather or shelter from the weather. So, our students rallied together and put together a video and wrote stories, posted to the board, and talked to the superintendent. [ ] There was a lot of energy behind this [ ] I couldn\\'t be more proud of the student body for coming together for a greater cause,\" said William Brown, principal of DSHS.  The estimated $7.93 million facility was largely funded from selling surplus property on Grande Avenue. In addition, there were extra funds left in the budget to help contribute to the cost. The All Student Center will provide more than just a proper cafeteria; it will double as a gathering space for the school and the greater Davis community.  Madhavi Sunder, Davis Board of Education president and UC Davis senior associate dean for academic affairs, was eager to see the project to come to life. \"There will be learning opportunities that can emerge from this facility,\" Sunder said. \"It also has a classroom space, a collaboration space, it has space for our student leadership groups and all student groups, and we wanted to build in a teaching kitchen so we could [ ] build a more robust culinary program in the future.\"  The All Student Center will be open before and after school, providing a safe environment for students to work together and community members to gather. It is expected to be completed within 12 months. ': 115,\n",

       " u' KMERON [CC BY 2.0] / FLICKRInterim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter confirms that event will not be cancelled Pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli will be featured during Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos\\' UC Davis stop on Jan. 13 for his \"Dangerous Faggot Tour\". \\xa0 Shkreli, who was suspended from Twitter after harassing female journalist Lauren Duca, is currently out on bail after being arrested for securities fraud. Shkreli is also infamous for raising the price of Daraprim, a drug that helps prevent infections for people with cancer or HIV, from $13.50 to $750 per pill, a 5,000 percent increase in price. Yiannopoulos, who has previously spoken out against feminism, political correctness and Islam, was also banned from Twitter due to racist tweets directed toward African American comedian Leslie Jones. UC Davis students have protested his upcoming visit on social media as well as through a public letter addressed to UC Davis administrators and the Davis College Republicans, the club hosting the event. The announcement that Shkreli would be joining Yiannopoulos came on the same day that Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter released a public letter regarding Yiannopoulos\\' impending visit to campus. Although Hexter reaffirmed UC Davis\\' Principles of Community and the need to support transgender students, he stated that the event would not be cancelled. \"Like most places of higher learning and teaching, UC Davis is a community for all ideas,\" Hexter wrote. \"As a public university, we remain true to our obligation to uphold everyone\\'s First Amendment freedoms. This commitment includes fostering an environment that avoids censorship and allows space for differing points of view. Therefore, we will not ask the Davis College Republicans to cancel their event.\" However, Hexter stressed that hate speech is never acceptable.  \"As a university leader, I take seriously my obligation to challenge discrimination whenever it emerges within our university community,\" Hexter said. \"Although I support the First Amendment\\'s commitment to free speech and encourage campus discussion of difficult issues, I will continue to voice my strong condemnation of messages that promote hate. I will stand proudly with the members of this community who oppose the spread of fear and intolerance.\"': 52,\n",
       " u' Kathleen Salvaty to oversee implementation of UC policy against sexual harassment, violence The University of California (UC) system announced in a press release that it hired Kathleen Salvaty as its first Title IX coordinator to lead efforts against sexual harassment and sexual violence throughout all 10 campuses. The position, which begins Feb. 6, is based at the University Office of the President (UCOP) and reports directly to UC President Janet Napolitano. Salvaty, a civil rights attorney, most recently worked as the Title IX coordinator at UCLA. At UCLA, she was responsible for designing and implementing education to prevent sexual violence and harassment and managed responses for reports of gender discrimination.  For the past few years, Napolitano and the UC system have worked to change the culture surrounding sexual harassment and violence and to improve timeliness and fairness in investigations of sexual misconduct.  \"Hiring [Salvaty] is a critical next step in making sure our recently overhauled policies to prevent, adjudicate and sanction sexual misconduct at UC are properly, and consistently, carried out,\" Napolitano said via the press release. Napolitano expressed the importance of making sure each member of the UC community feels safe and respected. The UCOP Compliance program created a task force in 2014 to address prevention and response to sexual violence and assault. Salvaty will direct the UC system\\'s efforts to continue improving Title IX compliance and oversee local Title IX coordinators to ensure implementation of university policies.  Wendi Delmendo, the chief compliance officer at UC Davis, works on the Ethics and Compliance Risk Committee of the Office of the Interim Provost. Delmendo also serves as UC Davis\\' Title IX officer and lead discrimination officer. Delmendo does not anticipate any administrative changes at UC Davis and acknowledges that the system-wide coordinator will be a resource to all the campuses.  \"The systemwide Title IX Officer will serve as a resource to the campus when issues arise that the campus would like to consult about,\" Delmendo said via email. \"The systemwide office can also provide investigative resources when needed to support the campus.\"  Delmendo believes that UC Davis has a strong program to respond to allegations of sexual violence and harassment. The campus offers a host of resources that are available for students.  \"This team includes the Title IX Office, the Harassment and Discrimination Assistance and Prevention Program (HDAPP), the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs (OSSJA), the UC Davis Police Department and the Center for Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE),\" Delmendo said. The Title IX officer hiring is important for the continued support of students, especially in light of recent debate over the effectiveness of campus resources and the ways in which administration has handled past sexual harassment situations.  Anastasia Ruttkay, a fourth-year international relations major, believes that the Title IX process has not worked in favor of sexual assault survivors thus far. \"It\\'s crucial for the UC system to hire a Title IX coordinator who can speak to the degree of sexual assault and who can rightfully advocate for sexual assault survivors,\" Ruttkay said via email. An ASUCD senator, Ruttkay\\'s platform focuses on sexual assault prevention within Greek life by providing resources and establishing a sexual assault prevention chair in every Greek chapter house. Ruttkay thinks that not enough students are committed to sexual assault prevention. \"There is a huge stigma towards sexual assault survivors, for it is extremely common for perpetrators along with many others to victim blame,\" Ruttkay said. \"The best thing we can do to improve this issue is to educate others around us with the main intention being to break the stigma towards sexual assault survivors, support the reporting process and ultimately stop sexual assault from occurring.\"': 21,\n",
       " u' Kevin Samy of Forbes\\' 2016 \"30 under 30\" list brings Dog Whistle event to UC Davis Kevin Samy, former speechwriter to the Obama Administration Secretary of Defense, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pentagon and special assistant to the Secretary of Energy, spoke at UC Davis on Jan. 13 as part of his Dog Whistle event. According to Samy, this event was hosted by the Davis College Democrats (DCD) as an alternative to Milo Yiannopoulos\\' UC Davis stop on his \"Dangerous Faggot\" Tour on the same day.  Yiannopoulos, an editor for Breitbart News and a controversial \"alt-right\" figure, planned to speak at a UC Davis event that was cancelled due to a large protest. UC Davis was Samy\\'s first official stop on his Dog Whistle Tour, sparked by a response to a Yiannopoulos event at Miami University. \"I thought, \\'Maybe I\\'ll stop in Ohio and offer another perspective\\',\" Samy said. \"We don\\'t have the resources of internet troll royalty that Milo does \\u2014 in three days, we packed a room full of hundreds of students.\"  According to the Dog Whistle Project\\'s Facebook and website, Samy and partner Chris Roessner\\'s mission is to \"decode the politics of hate and reaffirm our American identity, and shine a light on the algorithm of the kinds of messages and arguments they\\'re making that frankly appeal to the extreme fringe.\"  Samy said that he and Roessner, who could not attend the UC Davis event, began noticing a trend in politics since the recent presidential election \\u2014 dog whistle messages. Samy explained dog whistle politics as coded appeals or euphemisms. One example he gave was how supporting \"family values\" can be associated with anti-gay rhetoric.  \"We are not an America that says, \\'Since you\\'re Muslim, we\\'re going to put an asterisk by your name,\\'\" Samy said. \"I see the way people talk about immigrants from Pakistan and it riles you up.\" Samy believes that America needs to become more cognizant of dog whistle politics in order to prevent it.  \"There is a lack of depth of understanding of the mechanism by which this kind of affected coded strategy [dog whistling] works that is inherently deceitful,\" Samy said. \"I had conversations with people of color, and they wanted people to explain \\'What do we do now?\\'\" Samy also followed Yiannopoulos to the next leg of the \"Dangerous Faggot\" tour on Jan. 20 at the University of Washington.  In Samy\\'s opinion, Yiannopoulos was able to play the victim card after his cancelled UC Davis event. \"First, [Yiannopoulos\\'] message upon return [to the next day\\'s protest] was predictable and potent, rabble rousing around one-liners we can all agree with, such as \\'they care about diversity, but not diversity of opinion,\\'\" Samy said. \"Free speech can be used to tear down or build up. As a guy who goes around saying \\'faggot\\' and bad-mouthing entire groups of people, Milo embodies the former.\" Christian Monsees, DCD president and a third-year political science major, wanted to support Samy\\'s message and provide an alternative to Yiannopoulos\\' event. \"We are thrilled to have Kevin Samy in light of the [Yiannopoulos] event; he believes, as we do, in the dangers of the alt-right and how it\\'s damaging to our political system,\" Monsees said. \"He is here to talk about implicit bigotry and how politicians can use dog whistle politics to inspire hatred and bigotry that some people have in order to gain support. We believe that while it is absolutely important to enforce freedom of speech, that does not mean that you should invite just anyone onto a campus.\" Samy described Yiannopoulos as a \"provocateur\" and \"super-villain,\" monikers that Yiannopoulos has used to describe himself as well. \"Yiannopoulos is like a toddler in a Darth Vader costume,\" Samy said.  For Monsees, Yiannopoulos was not an appropriate guest for the UC Davis community. \"It is one thing to have the right to free speech, but it is another thing to deserve to be heard,\" Monsees said. However, Samy said that he still upholds Yiannopoulos\\' right to free speech. \"His action of espousing [his ideas] is an artifact of a functioning, open, free republic,\" Samy said. \"His existence is actually proof that our nation built on an ideal is working.\"': 31,\n",
       " u' LRDP update preserves Russell Boulevard fields for athletics UC Davis has confirmed that it no longer plans to construct student housing on the Russell Boulevard intramural fields (IM). At a public city council meeting held on \\xa0Dec. 6 to focus on the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP), Bob Seger, the assistant vice chancellor who is head of Campus Planning and Environmental Stewardship, said that Toomey, Howard and Russell Fields will all be maintained as athletic fields.  After Seger announced the Russell Boulevard withdrawal at the town hall meeting, he explained the alternative plan: demolishing existing inefficient, low-density housing and building tall high-density housing to utilize acreage and ease Davis\\' low vacancy rate. Construction will occur at empty West Village fields and on campus at Tercero, Orchard Park, Segundo, Solano Field and Cuarto. The map can be seen on the Campus Neighborhoods section of the LRDP draft, in which Russell Field is no longer designated for housing.  The Notice of Preparation Environmental Impact (NOP) report issued on Jan. 4 also confirmed the preservation of Russell Fields.  Davis Mayor Robb Davis and the City Council of Davis signed a resolution on Dec. 20 agreed upon by Davis community members to adjust the 2017-2027 LRDP. The resolution commits Ralph Hexter, UC Davis interim chancellor, to \"remov[ing] all construction from Russell, Howard and Toomey Fields and retain[ing] those fields for community and athlete use.\"  This 2017-2027 LRDP seeks to \"accommodate 90 percent of enrollment growth in campus housing and 40 percent of the Davis-based students in campus housing by 2027-28.\" The LRDP predicts 39,000 students will be enrolled by 2027, compared to the 32,663 students from 2015-2016.  The decision to no longer create housing on these fields comes after public backlash from students, athletes and members of the Facebook group Friends of Russell Blvd. Fields, all of whom resisted the development plan to take away the fields. They protested and advocated for athletic and community use of the fields through a petition, sending comments via e-mail to the LRDP planners and calling for town hall meetings. Advocates for both saving Russell Fields and increasing student housing encouraged the LRDP planners to consider the the Nishi Gateway as an alternate housing proposal. This proposed 45-acre mixed-use Davis district could increase student housing and provide commercial connectivity and walkability near the university, similar to the housing at West Village. The prospective development is nestled in the open space between Old Davis Road and Highway 80.  After UC Davis withdrew its plan to build on Toomey, Howard and Russell Fields, the Friends of Russell Fields Facebook page posted a message of appreciation. \"UC Davis has come to understand that the IM fields on Russell Blvd. are greatly valued by the broad community,\" the post read. Student-athletes who play on Russell Boulevard Fields are proud that they were able to help preserve the fields.  \"We are very excited that the University is preserving Russell Field,\" said Harrison Morrow, a third-year wildlife, fish and conservation biology major and UC Davis\\' rugby team captain. \"Not only is it important to various sport clubs at UC Davis, [but] Russell Field [also] serves as a recreation area for the entire student body.\" However, a large concern for students, the community and the university remains \\u2014 a growing, low-vacancy Davis still needs more student housing. Friends of Russell Blvd. Fields have proposed a 100 percent student enrollment growth and a 50 percent in on campus housing, higher than UC Davis\\' 90/40 plan 2017-2027 plan. \"We are, however, disappointed to learn [that] UC Davis continues to resist building student housing on par with most other UC campuses,\" a Friends of Russell Blvd. Fields Facebook post reads. \"The proposed \\'40 percent of the Davis-based students\\' to be housed on campus pales in comparison to the 50 percent most other UCs are striving for. There is a backlog of on-campus housing need that has not been provided yet by UCD, significantly impacting the Davis community. Even Interim Chancellor Hexter recently admitted to the UC Regents that UC Davis has \\'completely saturated\\' the Davis housing market, leading to extremely low vacancy rates. Davis is the largest UC at 5,300 acres and unquestionably has room for both the Russell Blvd. fields and more student housing.\" Colin Walsh, a former UC Davis athlete who graduated in 1996, is an advocate for preserving the fields. He described how the Davis community collaborated with the city council and mayor to save the fields.  \"The city council last month passed a resolution and sent a letter to the university calling for the university to build more student housing,\" Walsh said. \"As the campus is getting so much larger, students are still living so far away. Compared to when I was a student, there are so many students coming from far parts of Davis or Woodland.\" Despite the need for increased student housing, Walsh hopes that the fields can continue to be preserved.': 48,\n",

Senate Bill No. 35 clarified who the voting members of the Unit Relocation and Space Allocation Commission will be moving forward. With no objections, the bill was passed. Senate Bill No. X requires that all members who voted yes on the bill attend an event to educate themselves on the Muslim community. There were concerns of ingenuity and already \\xa0present \"woke-ness,\" or awareness of a community\\'s racial and social injustice, in student leaders. Chiang mentioned that Omar Awad, the president of the Muslim Student Association, would oversee the bill to keep student leaders accountable. After further discussion, the bill passed unanimously. Senate Resolution No. X concerns ASUCD supporting and advocating for more student housing on campus. With no objections, the resolution was passed. Committee Amendment No. 50 concerns creating a new judicial council and judicial council oversight committee (JCOC) after the court was dissolved last quarter. The amendment will be more institutionalized by having five members where one is a chairperson and the other four are commissioners.The chairperson will check in with Senate Pro-temp, who will also be in charge of hiring. Zach Nelson, a student who attended the meeting, brought up concerns of the JCOC being impartial and ASUCD closing its doors on students. Nelson\\'s concerns were answered by senators.  Chiang mentioned that the JCOC would only get involved if an appeal was made for the judicial council decision. Flores was worried about students with entry-level experience having the power to overturn Senate decisions. Multiple senators brought up disinterest in the student body to join the judicial branch and why internal hiring may lead to more motivated and invested judicial members.

       " u' Law to affect students selected to attend National Conference on Undergraduate Research  One of the many new California laws that took effect on Jan. 1 was Assembly Bill 1887, a bill written and sponsored by Assemblymember Evan Low (D-28). The law, a response to \"religious freedom\" and \"bathroom bills,\" prohibits state-funded travel to states outside of California with anti-LGBT laws. Since the University of California (UC) is funded by the state, this law impacts travel opportunities for both students and faculty. The four states where state-funded travel is currently prohibited are Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. \"The impetus for this [law] was that there were states that were passing very anti-LGBT, discriminatory laws,\" Low said. \"In response to that, companies, not only in my district, but companies, tech companies, industries, such as Hollywood, indicated that they would boycott and withdraw any of their businesses in these discriminatory states because they did not want to subject their employees to potential discrimination. [The state does] not want to subsidize discrimination.\" Low views this law as an attempt by California to ensure that it does not fund other states that do not uphold California\\'s values. \"The difference [between companies] and the State of California, so a government entity, and these are taxpayer dollars, so we will not allow taxpayer dollars to support any kind of discrimination, \" Low said. At least four UC Davis students and their sponsoring faculty will be impacted by this law, as they will not be able to receive funding from UC Davis to travel to the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) this April at the University of Memphis in Tennessee. \"The students can go with alternate travel funding, and approval of their supervising professor for whom they\\'d be presenting their research work,\" said Kimberly Hale, the interim director for UC Davis News and Media Relations, via email. \"The university cannot contribute to their travel expenses due to the location of the conference.\" One of the students who will be impacted by this law is Mark Rivera, a fourth-year cognitive science and religious studies double major, who was selected to attend the NCUR. \"It\\'s quite the obstacle,\" Rivera said. \"No, [I] probably [won\\'t look for alternative funding]. I don\\'t want to have to expend the extra energy and time. I\\'m just kind of like, \\'okay, oh well, I missed out.\\'\" Rivera did express some discontent with the law. \"It\\'s silly,\" Rivera said. \"I think it\\'s exacerbating the exact problem it\\'s trying to address. If they don\\'t allow people from other parts of the country to come in, it\\'s going to make [those states] even more insular.\" Low countered this argument, stating that upholding the Californian value of inclusion is a foundation of the new law. \"I understand that viewpoint; I respectfully disagree,\" Low said. \"You saw the backlash of impact that these laws had in various places. Because of the swift backlash from so many forward-thinking companies and businesses, we have seen that individuals feel that perhaps this was just a wedge issue. We really need to have this occur and hit [these states] in the pocketbook where it really matters.\" According to Hale, if arrangements for the conference had been made before Jan. 1, there would have been no problem funding the travel, as the law is not retroactive. That is, the law cannot make punish an act that would be considered illegal under the new rule if it was committed before the law was in effect. \"It\\'s possible that the arrangements for the conference were made before January 1,\" Hale said via email. \"Also, if the travel [is] not funded by the state of California, then it does not fall under this state law.\" Apart from not applying retroactively, there are six other exemptions to the law: enforcing California law, litigation, appearance requests from the federal government; performing functions to keep grant funding, completing training for employment that is not available in California; and for matters of public health, welfare or safety.': 20,\n",

They\\'re decorated in a way that we don\\'t do any other time of the year. The main reason, for me, to go, is the lighting part of this. I love that! And for the kids, of course, [it\\'s] Santa,\" Hughes said.  This year, there even more lights than usual to brighten the cobblestoned streets of Old Sacramento, and viewers can witness one notable change to program: Jack Frost. Coordinators encourage guests to keep an eye out for this whimsical character. After the production, attendees can shop or eat in the area, or just enjoy the 19th century holiday atmosphere. \"It\\'s a family friendly, free event that brings you down to Old Sacramento,\" Odehnal said.

       " u' Local Masjid had broken windows, slices of bacon on door The Islamic Center of Davis was the victim of vandalism early on the morning of Jan. 22, the suspect of which appears in a surveillance video as a female with long hair. Windows of the Masjid were broken and bacon was put on door handles in an attempt to offend the sensibilities of the Muslim community (Muslims are prohibited from eating pork). \\xa0 \"I think it\\'s really important to recognize that what is happening is kind of a surprise to all of us,\" said Nida Ahmed, the internal vice president of the Muslim Student Association of UC Davis. \"We just kind of woke up to this news that our Masjid, or our mosque, had been vandalized.\"  This incident, now being treated as a hate crime, comes in the wake of controversy surrounding an event hosted by the Davis College Republicans (DCR), featuring Milo Yiannopoulos of Breitbart News. Yiannopoulos has been called a spokesperson for the \"alt-right\", and his invitation to speak at UC Davis caused immediate outcry and protest, resulting in the cancellation of the event.  The crime also came just two days after the inauguration of President Donald Trump, who has advocated for the \"extreme vetting\" of Muslim persons.  The two events coinciding with this most recent hate crime have been the subject of discussion amongst those affected by the crime and their allies. However, members of the mosque have expressed their desire to continue to participate with Davis in spreading a message of tolerance.  \"Whenever something like this happens we\\'re always taken aback,\" Nida said. \"But I think something that we\\'re going to do to move forward is to engage with our communities. We\\'re going to make sure that they know that we\\'re here [ ] and that we are a part of this community.\" The Sacramento Valley chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-SV) issued a statement calling on state and federal law enforcement. The organization is offering a monetary reward for any information that leads to the arrest of the perpetrator.  \"We ask state law enforcement authorities and the FBI to investigate the apparent bias motive for this vandalism and to bring the perpetrator to justice,\" said Basim Elkarra, the executive director of CAIR-SV in a press release. \"The swift apprehension and punishment of those responsible for this act of religious intimidation will send the message that the growing Islamophobia we are witnessing in our nation will not be tolerated or ignored.\" In a message to the community, Interim Chancellor Ralph Hexter, Mayor Robb Davis and Adela de la Torre, vice chancellor for student affairs and campus diversity extended their sympathy to those who were affected by the crime.  \"We want to express the disgust, outrage, and sadness we feel over this incident. We know that it has caused, and continues to cause, great distress and fear among members of the Muslim communities at UC Davis and in the City of Davis,\" the message said.  In an effort to mend the damage inflicted on the Islamic Center, a LaunchGood funding campaign was started on Jan. 22 to raise money for repairs. The project has since raised almost 20,000 dollars, more than twice the initial goal amount, in less than 48 hours.  In collaboration with ASUCD, the Muslim Student Association is hosting a lecture series, \"The Davis Muslim,\" \"to spread awareness about Islam on campus, in light of recent historical events\" \"Even though this incident has happened, we\\'ve seen an outpour of love,\" Nida said.

       " u' Local author Matt Biers-Ariel\\'s latest novel Many believe that standardized testing is a measure of how smart students are, as if multiple choice answers could account for creative thinking. However, Light the Fire, Matt Biers-Ariel\\'s latest book, challenges this idea. Davis resident Biers-Ariel is a local English teacher in Winters. His book delves into student-teacher relationships and stresses how much schools and our society overlook creative thinking in favor of standardized testing. Biers-Ariel, however, frowns upon this practice. \"Standardized testing doesn\\'t measure creative thought, and I think a lot of problem-solving goes beyond critical thinking. You need to have creative thinking, and t\\'s impossible to measure that for standardized testing,\" Biers-Ariel said. Biers-Ariel has taught college preparatory English as well as Advanced Placement English Literature for the past 15 years. Before teaching in Winters, he grew up in L.A. and attended UC Berkeley.  Light the Fire isn\\'t the first book Biers-Ariel has written; all together he has published six books as well as satirical essays for magazines. Much of his inspiration for his latest novel stemmed from teaching, jotting down ideas from the classroom. However, most of his writing took place during the summer since there was little to no time to write during the academic year. One of his English courses read an earlier book of his as a class, and several students have also read Light the Fire in their own time. He hopes that many people read Light the Fire and work away from standardized testing, encouraging students to think outside the box. \"Official policy of the school is to not teach toward the test. Clearly, there is pressure to teach toward the test, or there\\'s pressure to have high scores,\" Biers-Ariel said.  \"Teaching toward the test\" is becoming rather common as students look to improve their grades and test scores for college admissions. Creative projects are substituted for worksheets and multiple choice tests, which aren\\'t helpful for students who tend to draw connections and interpret things in alternative ways. \"I do less [creative writing projects] with the AP class because those kids do take a high stakes test at the end of the year that counts for them \\u2013\\u2013 the AP test,\" Biers-Ariel said. \"The AP test does not reward you for creative thinking; it only rewards you for critical thinking and critical writing, so I mostly focus on that. But my regular English class does do a lot of creative work.\" The overall message that Light the Fire tries to portray is the disillusionment in standardized testing. It does not suffice to say that one is not smart just because they do not do well on multiple choice tests and worksheets; instead, students should be encouraged to think outside the box and work creatively. \"Every so often, a book tries to capture the dynamics between teachers and their students in a public school. Usually they miss the mark, but Light the Fire hits the bull\\'s eye,\" said Dean Vogel, former teacher and president of the California Teachers Association. \"As an educator for over 45 years, I am thoroughly impressed by Biers-Ariel\\'s ability to translate the feel of a classroom into a novel. This book is real. If you\\'ve ever wondered what it\\'s like being a teacher or \\u2013\\u2013 gasp \\u2013\\u2013 want to relive high school, you must read this book.\" For those who simply want to gain a new perspective on how schools tend to gear their students toward standardized testing, the book has been highly commended. \"It was a great pleasure to read this book,\" said Pamela Ronald, a reader of the book in an Amazon book review. \"I could not put the story down\\u2013read it in two days and wished for more. I enjoyed all aspects of this impressive work: the characters, the twists and turns, the humor and the empathy.\"': 91,\n",
       " u' Local groups meet every week to provide practice, support for those looking to build communication skills Public speaking is a valuable skillset that can have a profound impact on personal lives and professional careers. For many, however, it is a fear and anxiety-inducing endeavor. In a recent survey conducted by the National Institute for Mental Health, it was revealed that 74 percent of respondents reported feelings of anxiety in regard to public speaking. For people looking to conquer their fear of public speaking, there is a nonprofit educational resource that can help. Toastmasters International, founded in 1924, is an international organization that aims to help its members improve their communication, public speaking and leadership skills. \"Toastmasters International is a really large international organization with thousands of clubs, that exists to help people conquer their fear of public speaking and [ ] practice speaking and leadership skills [ ] Every meeting is kind of a practice business meeting,\" said Holly Wong, current president of the Davis Daytime Toastmasters. There are two Toastmasters clubs in the City of Davis. The Davis Town and Gown Toastmasters meet every Tuesday evening at 6 p.m., and the Davis Daytime Toastmasters meet every other Wednesday at 12 p.m. Wong first joined the Daytime Toastmasters to sharpen her public speaking and communication skills as she prepared for a career change. \"When I moved to Davis about a year ago, I decided that I wanted to go into consulting for myself, and realized that that would involve a lot more public speaking and being able to clearly communicate with potential clients,\" Wong said. \"I got involved with Toastmasters right when I moved to Davis so that I could be practicing those skills.\" Both Toastmaster clubs feature many roles for their members, including president, secretary, toastmaster, humorist, grammarian, timer, table topics master and general evaluator. Members switch roles every few months so that everyone is exposed to different leadership positions. Michael Bobell, longtime member and secretary of the Davis Daytime Toastmasters, likes the club because it provides a supportive environment for its members. \"What I like about it is there\\'s plenty of opportunity, especially because this is a smaller club, to speak,\" Bobell said. \"It\\'s a very kind audience: they\\'re very forgiving; they care about you; they give you support, and it gives you a chance to go in front and move beyond your comfort zone.\"  With practice, public speaking can become an enjoyable experience. Anna Pischer, a third-year chemical engineering major, said she thoroughly enjoys public speaking. \"I love public speaking,\" Pischer said. \"The last time I did it was when I spoke at my high school graduation [ ] Lots of people are scared of it, but I really enjoy it.\" Information about Toastmasters International can be found on its website.': 73,\n",

       " u' Mayor Robb Davis reaffirms that the City of Davis will not make any policy changes President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 25 threatening to withhold federal funds from cities and counties designated as \"sanctuary jurisdictions.\" \"Sanctuary jurisdiction\" is a loosely-defined term used to denote cities and counties that choose to limit their cooperation with federal immigration agencies. The controversial executive order, titled \"Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,\" was met with immediate opposition. Many sanctuary cities have publicly stated that they will not change their policies. The City of Davis has been a sanctuary city since 1986, and Mayor Robb Davis recently reaffirmed that the city will not change its policies or status. Other notable sanctuary cities include New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Davis explained that the City of Davis\\' sanctuary policy is simple: police do not, under any circumstance, inquire about immigration status. \"The police will not ask, seek to know, or record someone\\'s [immigration] status in any interaction [ ] This is something that we\\'ve done, as many other cities have, to encourage trust in the police so that if something happens to someone, they\\'re not fearful of contacting the police,\" Davis said. \\xa0 Davis believes that President Trump\\'s executive order will make cities less safe. \"Imagine if you\\'re someone who is brought to this country, and you\\'ve been trafficked and you\\'re not here legally. Are you going to contact the police to save yourself? Maybe not. So I believe that this action [Trump\\'s executive order] will make cities less safe because people who are victims of crimes will not come forward,\" Davis said. According to Davis, the City of Davis is not breaking any laws in reaffirming its sanctuary city status and refusing to change its policies. \"Our police chief [and] our city attorney have stated unambiguously that we are following all state and federal laws and the Constitution by acting the way we\\'re acting,\" Davis said. \"We don\\'t have any concerns about the administration\\'s threats [ ] the Trump Administration is absolutely just blowing smoke. We\\'re not in a position where we\\'re going to be acquiescing simply because the president says we need to be an enforcement arm of immigration.\" Andrew Casas, a second-year English major, disagrees with Davis\\' affirmation of sanctuary city status. He believes it contributes to division and polarization within the American political system. \"Whether you like Donald Trump or whether you dislike Donald Trump, he\\'s the President of the United States. It\\'s the same thing that happened with Barack Obama when the Republicans were in Congress; he was trying to do his best and people just kind of screwed him over with \\'no, we\\'re not going to pass any of his bills\\' [ ] We should be working with the president to do our best to make the best America possible,\" Casas said. Jessica Angel-Gonzalez, a fifth-year animal science major at UC Davis, agrees with Davis\\' stance on sanctuary city policies. She does not believe that anyone should be questioned about their immigration status by police if they are not breaking the law. \"For somebody to come around asking random questions like \\'Hey, are you a citizen here?\\' It\\'s kind of none of their business. If they\\'re doing nothing wrong, then it shouldn\\'t be right for someone to [have to] show documentation. I\\'m completely against what Trump is trying to do with defunding the cities [ ] I think Davis is doing a good job by keeping this a sanctuary city,\" Angel-Gonzalez said. Sanctuary city policies protect undocumented immigrants from city and county law enforcement agencies, but they do not offer protection from federal law enforcement agencies. On Feb. 5, an undocumented immigrant living in Davis was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The individual in question had visited the Davis DMV office a few days prior to pay a ticket and apply for an Assembly Bill #60 driver\\'s license. AB #60, signed into California law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2013, makes it possible for someone to receive a California driver\\'s license without proof of legal residence.  The undocumented individual had multiple arrest warrants, and his AB #60 application prompted Immigration and Customs Enforcement to arrest him at his home a few days later. The legality of President Trump\\'s executive order remains to be determined by the judicial system. Several sanctuary cities, including San Francisco, have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the order.': 62,\n",
       " u' More than 600 women\\'s marches held throughout the world In response to the recent election and inauguration of President Donald Trump, thousands of women\\'s rights activists rallied in front of the California State Capitol Building on Jan. 21 to join in the fight to protect equal rights for women and for all.  \"Ladies, and those of you that love them, respect them and know that they deserve equal rights, thank you for being here today,\" said Angelique Ashby, a City of Sacramento councilmember, at the March on Sacramento.  The Sacramento Police Department estimated that around 20,000 people attended the rally on the west steps of the California State Capitol Building after a one-mile march that began at Southside Park. The March on Sacramento was just one of nearly 600 sister marches that took place around the world in support of women\\'s rights, with the grassroots march taking place in Washington, D.C. This march was the first of its kind and welcomed any person, regardless of gender identity, to attend in support of women\\'s rights. Women, men and individuals of all ages, races, ethnicities and religious and social backgrounds were in attendance.  As countless individuals chanted, \"The people united will never be divided\" and \"We\\'ve got stamina,\" many other people carried posters and banners with slogans reading, \"Love not hate makes America great\" and \"Love is love.\" Nikki Eman, a fourth-year environmental policy and planning major at UC Davis, attended the event to show her support for equal rights and for climate change research, another issue that has been challenged by the current U.S. administration. She was proud to attend the march and felt empowered by all the people present. \"The atmosphere of the crowd is especially inspiring. Just seeing everyone out here trying to show their representatives that they care is amazing,\" Eman said. Numerous organizations set up tables at the march as well. Some of the groups that participated included the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Women\\'s Empowerment, My Sister\\'s House and the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). NASW works to be a voice for social justice by bringing resources and services such as mental health and professional support to individuals in need. Anthony DiMartino, the chair of the NASW local chapter, said that he is proud to work for the organization and serve as a voice for people who are underrepresented.  \"[The organization] is a place to be with other people who are working for social justice and serving people,\" DiMartino said. \"It\\'s good to be around other individuals who are serving similar goals and dreams.\" Individuals present at the event showed support for one another through tactics such as banners and safety pins as a message that they stood beside vulnerable, minority groups who may have felt targeted by remarks made by the President Trump. As the event continued, dance and music groups such as the Sacramento Taiko Dan and Sacramento Women\\'s Chorus performed, and local politicians spoke in solidarity for the event. Mayor of Sacramento Darrell Steinberg spoke about how proud he was to see the march\\'s outcome. \"Our values proclaim that all of our population is worthy of equal pay, equal opportunity and basic reproductive rights,\" Steinberg said.  Councilmember Ashby stressed that individuals should get involved in the community by joining committees, boards and organizations that promote social activism.': 79,\n",

       " u' Muslim Student Association curates five-part Davis Muslim lecture series The UC Davis Muslim Student Association (MSA) will host a five-part Islam awareness lecture series on campus for students in response to the current political climate and prevalence of negative attitudes toward Islam. The hour-long lectures, which include topics such as \"The Chameleon Muslim\" and the \"Rituals and Practices of Muslims,\" illuminate the shared and diverse experiences of Davis Muslims. \\xa0\\xa0 Kumran Islam, a Muslim alumnus of UC Davis, spoke at the opening event on Jan. 25, entitled \"What is Islam,\" to dispel myths and spread accurate knowledge regarding the Muslim religion. Islam\\'s lecture provided an interactive introduction to the series, as he encouraged participation, questions and debate from the audience.  The recent Islamic Center of Davis hate crime emboldened Islam to speak and question the acceptance of his religion within America. Islam spoke about the Jan. 22 attack on the Islamic Center of Davis, where an unidentified female vandal laid bacon on door handles and shattered windows.  \"I thought it was important to come today considering the recent hate attack on the local masjid,\" Islam said. \"I think it\\'s not only important for us to be aware of our Muslim brothers and sisters, but to understand how incidents like this cause us to reflect upon ourselves and who we are as American people \\u2014 whether we truly fulfill the ideals that we proclaim to [have] as an American society.\" Two days after the first Davis Muslim lecture, on Jan. 27, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to temporarily ban travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries.  Hansa El-Nounou, a first-year communications major, an MSA member and an upcoming speaker at the Feb. 15 talk, felt disenfranchised by the new president\\'s executive order.  \"My personal, and others\\', reaction was kind of that of mortification.\" El-Nounou said. \"We were holding onto the hope that he wasn\\'t actually going to pull through with it. It was really scary, but also, in a weird way, it was empowering to the community because we realized we have to stick together. We\\'re doing our best to be good Americans.\"  Aafreen Latheef, a third-year civil engineering major and MSA member, worked in conjunction with ASUCD to present the lecture series. Latheef felt compelled to respond to political and social contention surrounding Islam.  \"The problem, especially with the current president, is that there\\'s a lot of bigotry towards minorities and a lot of Muslim people are feeling threatened and attacked,\" Latheef said. \"We just wanted to spread knowledge about Islam.\" Adilla Jamaludin, a former ASUCD senator and a third-year international agricultural development major, started planning the series last quarter.  \"I came up with this idea when I was still a senator with ASUCD last year, and the whole idea was that with the current political climate, it just seemed like the right time to have an informational series of lectures about the Muslim faith,\" Jamaludin said. \"For me, it\\'s really nice to see this series happen because there\\'s different experiences for different Muslims on campus. There isn\\'t just one mold of what a Muslim is and it\\'s important to have that type of diversity of experiences shared. It\\'s also a great way for other students who are learning about Islam or the Middle East to be exposed to it on their own campus.\"  Latheef invites and encourages non-Muslims interested in Islam to attend the remaining events.': 13,\n",

The event, hosted by the Davis College Republicans (DCR) club, is free to the public.  Yiannopoulos, whose other upcoming tour stops include UC Santa Barbara and UC Berkeley, was the speaker most likely to be disinvited to colleges in 2016, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. In December, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Yiannopoulos had signed a book deal for $250,000 with Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster. In the past, Yiannopoulos has railed against political correctness, feminism and Islam. He was famously banned from Twitter in July 2016 after a series of racist and sexist tweets aimed at African American comedian Leslie Jones. \"[Yiannopoulos] is known for discussing topics, both political or not, that may offend some people but not others,\" DCR wrote on the event page. \"Please be aware of this when attending. Some topics may not be suitable for youth.\" In a letter created by UC Davis graduate students, over 900 students, faculty, staff and alumni called for campus administrators and DCR to cancel the event, arguing that the hosting the event would go against UC Davis\\' Principles of Community. \"Milo Yiannopoulos is well known for his espousal of racist, sexist and Islamophobic hate speech targeted towards numerous members of our campus community,\" the letter read. \"The use of campus facilities and resources to host and therefore legitimize a white nationalist runs completely counter to the stated goals of the University of California and serves as a direct threat toward traditionally marginalized groups on campus. If the University of California, Davis is indeed committed to \\'maintaining a climate of equity and justice demonstrated by respect for one another,\\' then campus administrators must rescind the use of campus facilities for this event and condemn the presence of white supremacy on campus.\" The letter further argued that by allowing Yiannopoulos to speak on campus, UC Davis administrators would foster discrimination in the campus community. \"We demand that UC Davis administrators remove Milo Yiannopoulos\\' platform for spreading hate and bigotry on our campus and issue a statement condemning white nationalist rhetoric within our community,\" the letter read. \"Now is the time for our university to take a firm stand and prove its commitment to inclusivity and egalitarianism in the face of growing exclusionist movements throughout the United States [ ] the University administration is obligated to oppose discrimination and foster a safe campus climate \\'to protect all members of our community [and] ensure their continued success at the University.\\' If they truly believe these words, the decision to cancel the Milo Yiannopoulos event should be an easy one to make.\" According to Deborah Porter, the DCR political director and a fourth-year biological systems engineering major, the club anticipated the campus community\\'s strong reaction to Yiannopoulos\\' visit. \"As a campus club open to challenging our community, we decided to host [Yiannopoulos] in order to allow our people the opportunity to hear about ideas, policies and theories that may be entirely alien to their background,\" Porter said via e-mail. \"While the Davis College Republicans do not endorse Milo or his speaking points, we do believe that college is a period in life where students must be aware of others\\' beliefs and able to support their own values.\" Porter hopes that community members from both sides of the political spectrum will come and listen to Yiannopoulos\\' talk with an open mind. \"We hope that liberals alongside conservatives attend Milo\\'s talk with the purpose of pondering his ideas, asking difficult questions and promoting UC Davis as a place where we challenge the ideas set before us rather than blindly accepting them,\" Porter said. \"As members of this community, and members of the Davis College Republicans, we invite all people to peacefully attend this event.\" However, Amara Miller, a fifth-year sociology graduate student, who helped create the petition asking the UC Davis administration to cancel the event, believes that the right to free speech does not mean that a platform for hate speech should be allowed.': 53,\n",

       " u' New fees to pay for equipment replacement To compensate for a decrease in university-allotted funds, the Department of Physical Education has proposed adding a fee to physical education (PE) classes starting in the fall of 2017. The funds would be allocated to equipment replacement and additional costs associated with specific classes. Previously, students could enroll in PE classes for a half-unit without paying any fees beyond baseline tuition costs. But starting next Fall Quarter, classes such as badminton or tennis that use additional equipment will cost between $1 and $2.50. Classes that don\\'t require any equipment, like fitness walking or swimming, will remain free of additional costs. The biggest increase will apply to archery, rock climbing, self defense and golf classes due to the additional resources and equipment needed.  According to Barbara Jahn, the supervisor of the Department of Physical Education, the department is aiming to keep costs as low as possible while also working to improve the quality of PE classes. \"In order to maintain these classes, which are extremely popular, we are proposing that we [apply a] charge,\" Jahn said. \"That\\'s so we can continue teaching classes and replacing equipment [ ] I don\\'t really like charging the students who are already paying for their classes, but we have to figure out a way to economically to continue. We are not getting the financial support in that area from the administration.\" Some students feel as though the additional fee is unwarranted, as they already pay tuition to take classes. Stephen Curry, a second-year chemical engineer major, is currently enrolled in a rock climbing class. Curry explained that the price hike would have deterred him from taking the class. \"It\\'s ridiculous,\" Curry said. \"I definitely wouldn\\'t have taken the class if it cost money, but they are lots of fun and they are a great way to maintain a balanced life. Some students don\\'t have the time to go to the gym and with PE classes it forced me to stay fit and it made time in my schedule to go to the gym.\" Jahn predicted that class enrollment would see little change. She said that the golf program, for example, already charges a fee to cover use at the Davis Municipal Golf Course but still consistently has full enrollment. \"It might [impact enrollment], but I don\\'t think so,\" Jahn said. \"Right now those golf courses are full and they are paying $23. For the self defense class, I don\\'t think that people would consider not taking that.\" Matthew Stuke, a second-year neurobiology, physiology and biology major, had considered taking a PE class but explained that an increased price on top of tuition for a low unit class would possibly make him reconsider.': 11,\n",

       " u' New showcase provides opportunity for students to learn about city\\'s history A new exhibit recently opened at Peter J. Shields Library to celebrate the upcoming centennial of the City of Davis. The showcase, titled \"Davis 1917-2017: Celebrating 100 Years of Community,\" features material from more than 15 separate collections and will be on display until June 18. Sara Gunasekara, a public services and archives specialist at the Shields Library, said that the project provides a lot of historical background pertaining to the founding of Davis, which was incorporated as a city on March 28, 1917. The previous year, a large fire had struck the downtown business district, creating a need for redevelopment. \"So one of the key things was that there was a fire in downtown Davis in November of 1916,\" Gunasekara said. \"It hadn\\'t yet been incorporated, there was talk of incorporation in 1911 and then in the spring of 1916 they had started talking about incorporating again but hadn\\'t really gotten their feet under them.\" The exhibit, which is free and open to the public during normal library hours, includes unique photographs and personal papers which document the city\\'s 100-year history. Jessica Nusbaum, the associate director of communications and marketing for the library, said that much of the material provided from the library\\'s Special Collections has been well received. \"One of the things that\\'s cool about Special Collections here at the UC Davis library is that we have some stuff that no one else has,\" Nusbaum said. \"So even the city was like, \\'oh you guys have good pictures from the fire? Can we have those \\'cause we wanna help tell that story that was so integral to the founding of the city, too.\\' So there\\'s some really unique pieces here at Special Collections that go beyond even what the city itself has and we\\'re really proud to help tell the local history story that way.\" The library\\'s online page includes further material on the exhibit as well as links and information for the multiple collections from which the materials were gathered. Stacy Winton, a media and communications officer for the City of Davis, said that Davis has been thankful for the exhibit. \"With our utmost gratitude, we thank UC Davis\\' Special Collections staff for creating an impressive exhibit of the City\\'s history over the past 100 years,\" Winton said via email. For Gunasekara, working on the exhibit presented a fulfilling experience to examine the history of both UC Davis and the City of Davis. \"I think for me, it was just a really enjoyable exhibit to work on,\" Gunasekara said. \"They\\'re all fun but for me, it was such a large story to tell about the history. Of course I couldn\\'t tell the entire minutiae of the history, but I greatly enjoyed working on it and learning more about the town I come to work in everyday.\" Nusbaum said that the exhibit will be open long enough for students and their families to visit through Spring 2017. As students continue to visit, Gunasekara hopes that they can understand the value in what the library has been able to gather through its many exhibits. \"Having exhibits like this out that I think people can really connect with is also a way to educate students about all of the amazing resources that Special Collections has here at the library,\" Nusbaum said. \"And without the exhibits, people might not have a way to find out that there are all these historic materials here at the library. You know, people may not know that the library is a repository for that kind of storytelling of the history of the campus and the history of the local community if we didn\\'t do things like this.\" ': 9,\n",
       " u' New, modern laundromat spreads love, laundry around Davis Adding to the ever-growing, enriched Davis community, Love Laundry opened as the second laundromat in town. While The Laundry Lounge on Hanover Dr. remains open, this new laundry facility caters to residents on the east side of town.  Love Laundry is located at 1776 E. 8th St. in the Davis Manor Shopping Center. Open 7 days a week from 5 a.m. to 12 a.m., the laundry facility caters to everyone from busy parents to students with any type of schedule.  \"The reason why we are [open from 5 a.m. to midnight] is because of the business out here,\" said Petra Montano, Love Laundry manager. \"You have the college, you have a lot of business people, you want to have the door open so that people can get their laundry done on their time. That\\'s the need.\" This family-owned laundromat opened for business on Dec. 30, 2016. In addition to a self-serve laundry service, it offers a drop-off laundry service, in which all soap and other laundry materials are provided. The staff washes, dries and even folds the laundry. Customers can choose next-day pick-up or same-day service for a slightly higher fee.  Owner Chris Washnsiedler saw the need for another laundromat in Davis and chose to open the location, amounting to six Love Laundry locations total. There are two in Southern California and three in Sacramento. Washnsiedler noted that some Davis residents even used to go to the Sacramento locations for laundry services.  \"We are excited to be in Davis,\" Wahnsiedler said in an interview with The Davis Enterprise. \"We\\'ve been looking in Davis for a while now. Everyone needs to do laundry [ ] it\\'s resistant to economic issues.\" Ailin Goff, a second-year biochemistry and molecular biology student, has been working at Love Laundry for a short time now and is grateful that it accommodates student\\'s class and extracurricular schedules. \"I showed them my schedule [ ] and they told me they would work with every single day,\" Goff said. \"It\\'s a very happy work environment. Everyone is really friendly.\" The washers in the facility range from basic top-loaders to cost efficient front-load washers for bigger loads. The machines range from a capacity of one to eight loads. All of the dryers in the laundromat are free to use. There are 35 washing machines and 34 dryers, leaving an abundance of machines always open to use. ': 81,\n",

       " u' On Thursday, Nov. 17 ASUCD held its last meeting before the Thanksgiving break. Senators Shaitaj Dhaliwal and Sam Park were absent. The first piece of legislation presented was Senate Bill #19, introduced by Senator Adilla Jamaludin. SB #19 would allocate $102 from senate reserves for 20 self-care gift bags for a mental health and grief workshop. \"The purpose of this mental health and grief workshop is to help students realize they are not alone in dealing with grief and to have students aware of the different resources available on campus,\" the bill read. \"Furthermore, the event will also give students the opportunity to discuss the frustrations and challenges they face, in particular, self-care and how to talk to friends about issues.\" The bill passed with a vote of 10-0-2, with Dhaliwal and Park abstaining. The next item on the agenda was SB #22, which removes all mentions of the Outreach Assembly (OA) from Chapter 2 of the ASUCD Bylaws, replacing it with the Department of Outreach and Recruitment. SB #22 was authored by Nick Flores of the Internal Affairs Commission (IAC), and subsequently introduced by the IAC. \"In the spring 2016 special election, Constitutional Amendment #45 passed, dissolving the OA from the ASUCD Constitution,\" the bill read. \"OA is to be replaced by the Department of Outreach and Recruitment and is to be moved from the Legislative Branch into the Executive Branch. Since the Amendment passed, the Bylaws need to be updated accordingly. This bill will fix all changes that need to be made in Chapter 2 of the ASUCD Bylaws.\" Similarly, SB #23, also authored by Flores, removed all mentions of the OA from chapters 10, 11, 14, 16 and 22 of the ASUCD Bylaws and replaced it with the Department of Outreach and Recruitment. Both SB #22 and #23 passed with a vote of 10-0-2, again with abstentions from Dhaliwal and Park. During public discussion, emergency legislation was introduced by Senator Samantha Chiang to allocate $31.69 to purchase flowers and admiration bags for the six senators terming out in fall 2016. While the exiting senators expressed gratitude for the gesture, the legislation was not passed, with a vote of 3-7-2, concluding voting for the day. After reports and announcements by ex officio members and elected officials of the senate, the meeting minutes for Nov. 10 were passed. The meeting adjourned shortly before 8 p.m.': 59,\n",
       " u' Ornamental piano outside Mishka\\'s Caf\\xe9 vandalized in broad daylight The public piano on the corner of Second and E Streets was vandalized in broad daylight on Nov. 1. The piano was one of five set out this summer by the City of Davis as part of the \\'In the Key of Davis\\' program. The program, which was conceived two years ago by local high school students, places pianos in public settings around Davis for community members to play. \\xa0 The piano that was vandalized was a particularly artistic one \\u2014 over the summer, it had been painted by artist Will Durkee. \"I designed that piano to inspire people, to make it colorful and interesting, and I was trying to make normal life more interesting. [ ] I feel that art and music are some of the most important, joyful things in the human experience,\" Durkee said. The piano was well-liked by many Davis residents. Loshandra Ostrava, a piano and guitar instructor who teaches both privately and at the UC Davis Experimental College, frequents Downtown Davis and enjoys the public pianos. \"I think it was great, [ ] it turned that into even more of a public space. [ ] It\\'s a really organic way for people to share, and I was just amazed at the musicians coming through and playing it, students and community alike,\" Ostrava said. \"I don\\'t think that vandalism should preclude them replacing it with another piano.\" The damage to the piano was extensive and irreparable. It has been given to the Peregrine School in South Davis, where students will reimagine its purpose. Artist Will Durkee, the painter of the piano, sees this donation as the silver lining of the vandalism. \"They\\'re going to try and rebuild it and turn it into like a cool art project, you know, to try and repurpose it in a creative way, so I think that\\'s really good. [ ] Creativity will always be more powerful than destruction,\" Durkee said. Davis police have reported that there has been an increase in vandalism in the past few weeks. They have asked anyone with information regarding vandalism or other crimes to report it by calling their main phone number at 530-747-5400. \\xa0': 104,\n",
       " u' Participants gathered for 5k, 10k, half marathon races Five, four, three, two, one  Go! Those were the words that sent off just over 1,750 runners in the 29th annual Davis Turkey Trot on Nov. 19. The chilly and rainy weather didn\\'t stop these determined athletes from running their hearts out. Hosted by A Change of Pace Foundation, race events included a 5k, 10k, half marathon and kids\\' fun runs.  Many who have run in similar events know the kind of atmosphere community races provide; they tend to offer another reason to run besides the competition alone. Some run the event for fun while others seek a challenge. Amber King, fourth-year managerial economics major, knows just what that feels like. \"I decided to run the Turkey Trot because my co-workers at FIT House Davis were sponsoring it,\" King said. \"Even though I didn\\'t put in much time training, I knew it was my last chance to run it again before I graduate.\" Regardless of why people chose to run, it\\'s clear that this Davis tradition is more than just another race: it\\'s a way to bring people of all backgrounds together to promote well-being and a sense of community. According to Dave Miramontes, race director and executive director of A Change of Pace, the encouraging environment of the event has increased attendance and attracts people from nearly 250 cities.  \"Over the years, when we first started this, it was a very highly competitive event,\" Miramontes said in an interview with KCRA Sacramento. \"After about five, six, or seven years into it, we decided it was going to be more of a family tradition, a family style race. So our numbers boosted [ ] It is a pretty popular event for both competitive runners, for people who are just starting their running careers, and for various reasons, and for the middle of the packers.\" 1st place results for the 5k, 10k, and half marathon are as follows: 5k: Adam Cobert, 15:57.123 10k: Clancy Mcconnell, 32:55.770 \\xbd: Reed Scott, 1:19:55.217 A Change of Pace organizes numerous running events throughout the year in Davis and Sacramento.

       " u' Participants line up for Thanksgiving 5k before gobbling up dinner feasts For the eighth year in a row, the Yolo Food Bank (YFB) will host the Running of the Turkeys on Thanksgiving morning at 8 a.m. on Nov. 24 \\u2014 this annual event features a 5k Fun Run/Walk. YFB also hired a race coordinator this year to help organize the family (and dog) friendly event. The Fun Run/Walk will begin and finish in Woodland at Heritage Plaza and will take participants through the historic sites in the city. Prizes go to the top three male and top three female overall finishers, as well as the top three finishers for both men and women in a wide-range of age categories. The \"fun\" portion of the Fun Run/Walk also presents prizes to the best dressed participant, first dog finisher and the largest team.  The proceeds from this event go toward YFB programs, services and partnerships, including the Kids\\' Farmers Market, Holiday Food Distribution and regular food assistance programs.  The money from these fees go directly to the YFB. The nonprofit estimates that every dollar yields enough food for two to three meals. The event helps them work toward their overall goal and mission of ending hunger across the county.  According to YFB\\'s official press release for the event, \"Yolo Food Bank is committed to increasing access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and works to educate the community on healthy eating. We distribute more than 4 million pounds of food annually.\" YFB development associate Becky Beaman is leading the event planning and hopes that the fun run allows for community outreach, including sharing information about YFB programs and services and reaching out to potential donors, volunteers or people in need of YFB\\'s services.  \"There are two main goals,\" Beaman said. \"[One big goal of the fundraiser is to] raise about $50,000 for yolo food bank. The other big goal is to bring awareness about the food bank and what it is that we do.\" YFB Marketing and Communications Coordinator Kevin Brown worked as a photographer for last year\\'s Running of the Turkeys; this year, however, he registered for the race and plans to take pictures from a runner\\'s perspective. \"My best memory was being at the starting gate [last year ] was this big, giant inflatable arch for the starting and finish line,\" Brown said. \"Seeing all the different people running it, because it\\'s all different ages [ ] and seeing the crowd come toward me, it was really electric. It was a beautiful way to start Thanksgiving.\" Lloyd Knox, a professor in the Department of Physics, is organizing a campus team for the Running of the Turkeys fundraiser for the fifth consecutive year \\u2014 and this year\\'s team has a new name: The Running Coupling Constants. Knox encourages everyone to join in support for YFB. \"More than 20 percent (44,000) of Yolo County residents do not have enough to eat,\" said Knox in a Dateline UC Davis University News article, \"Holiday Helping: A Food Drive and Fun Run\". \\xa0\"One in four children do not know where their next meal will come from.\" Children ages 5 and under, can enter the race for free. Participants ages 6 to 17 can register for a little over $20 and those 18 and older can sign up for the race and service fee of $41. However, the cost of registration increases slightly on Nov. 22.

       " u' Petco Foundation awards $10,000 to local animal shelter For the past four years, the Petco Foundation has held its Holiday Wishes grant campaign, in which people who have adopted pets are able to submit stories of how their pets have changed their lives. This year, the grant money amounted to $750,000, including a $100,000 grand prize. Rotts of Friends, originally founded by Renee Lancaster in Woodland, started off rescuing rottweilers and German shepherds but expanded to rescuing dog breeds of all kinds, and now rescues cats as well. As a rescue foundation staffed by volunteers, it can apply for grants, although this was the first time the foundation had entered in the Holiday Wishes campaign. With a total of 5,100 submissions, Rotts of Friends was one of 54 finalists in the campaign. Touching the hearts of many, its story of a rescued pit bull named Disney won the foundation $10,000. \"When guests give a donation at checkout in a Petco or Unleashed by Petco store, their contributions enable the foundation to make big investments in lifesaving animal welfare organizations across the country,\" said Lisa Lane, the manager of press relations and communications at Petco. Donations for grants like these benefit animal foundations or shelters in order to provide for their rescued pets.  Rotts of Friends was encouraged to enter in the Holiday Wishes campaign by Gina Knepp, manager of the Front Street Animal Shelter in Sacramento, whom the company closely partners with.  Disney\\'s story started with a homeless man in Humboldt County, who abandoned Disney as he moved on. She was then taken to the Humboldt County animal shelter, where she stayed until their funding sent her to Rotts of Friends to be trained for a future home.  \"She was with us at Rotts of Friends for a long time,\" said Barbara McNaughton, Community Outreach Coordinator at Rotts of Friends. \"No one was even interested in looking at her because she was a pitbull, despite the fact that everyone at Rotts of Friends knew she was going to make a great companion for someone who would give her a chance. Then came Jessica who adopted Disney.\" Jessica Bishop\\'s story about Disney described how she, as a veteran, underwent a tough transition in her life, coming from long-term deployment and battling loneliness and depression. Bishop hoped to adopt a dog in order to fill the empty space in her life. \"Disney is more than just a dog; she is my family,\" Bishop wrote. \"Military life can be very lonely. Now in my mid-thirties, as a single woman who has been doing this alone for over a decade, I have found a sense of purpose and joy, thanks to Disney.\"  Disney was rescued and given a home, and Bishop found that adopting Disney helped her find herself and provided her with a much-needed companion. \"Disney has been attached to my hip ever since. She\\'s chewed up flip flops, destroyed rolls of paper towels, but in the process has taught me patience and how great it feels to care for something other than oneself,\" Bishop wrote. \"She\\'s filled the hole in my heart and changed my life for the better. It\\'s not always easy to handle a strong-willed, type-A hard-headed lady, but she mirrors me, and we learn from each other every day. I\\'m so thankful for finding her and the changes she has brought to my life.\" This touching story was selected by the Petco Foundation team for the grant, and it is now featured on its website. \"Disney\\'s story is a wonderful example of how pets can help people through difficult life challenges. It\\'s always better to have someone in your corner through a tough time, and Disney was just that for Jessica as she transitioned back to life after deployment,\" Lane said. \"All of the winning stories told a story rather than simply reciting facts as they happened. Quality storytelling and excellent supporting photos or videos made Disney\\'s and the other winning submission stand out from all the others.\" With the $10,000 grant, Rotts of Friends plans to purchase a gently-used full-size van, which will help transport rescued animals. In addition, the shelter is building a 26,000 square-foot rescue dog sanctuary. This will help the team add to the 250 dogs and cats already rescued per year.': 87,\n",
       " u' Police chief provides information about safety, Unitrans asks riders to remain patient throughout delays  \\xa0A deluge of winter rain recently hit the UC Davis campus \\u2014 in the period of Jan. 1 to Jan. 18, 7.83 inches of rain were measured in the nearby Sacramento Executive Airport according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Large amounts of rain pose a particular set of challenges for campus management and students, especially when it comes to maintaining safety. According to Interim UC Davis Police Chief Jennifer Garcia, the most important part of remaining safe is planning ahead. \"Check the weather before leaving [for campus], especially if you are going to be gone all day,\" Garcia said. \"For students, you leave your home in the morning and you don\\'t go back until the evening or sometimes late in the evening. Check the weather throughout the day. It might be really sunny and bright in the morning but by the evening it\\'s torrential floods.\" Even in the rain, police officers have to be ready to respond at a moment\\'s notice. Garcia encourages students to make use of police officer\\'s weather preparation methods. \"One of the things we like to encourage officers to do is to have what we call a \\'go bag,\\' in a case like this when we are experiencing flooding [ ],\" Garcia said. \"In a \\'go bag,\\' you have extra socks, extra clothes, your toiletries, any medications you might need, jammies, snacks, a couple bottles of water \\u2014 to have that in your car at all times. I suggest that for everybody in times of severe weather.\" According to Garcia, a lot of work related to winter weather, especially flooding, falls onto UC Davis Facilities Management. \"What we do for severe weather is we do rely on Facilities [Management] to supply sandbags if needed, and they would be the response to areas on campus that are flooding as far as if we need to divert the water or pump out the water of a basement,\" Garcia said. \"We would work with Safety Services risk management if there was a major problem on campus.\" Garcia also advised students to take extra caution when biking during severe weather. \"Wear some sort of reflective gear, because when it\\'s darker out it\\'s harder to see people,\" Garcia said. \"Also your peripheral vision is very important when you are driving and/or on a bike and even walking. So you want to make sure that your headgear, even though you\\'re trying to keep yourself really warm, you\\'ve got to make sure that your peripheral vision is really clear.\" This extra caution when driving also applies to Unitrans drivers. According to Amelia Bizjak, the operations manager for Unitrans, bus drivers must take extra precautions to maintain safety. \"Logistically, the rain provides an extra challenge for our drivers, similar to how driving in the rain in a car is more difficult,\" Bizjak said via email. \"Like in a car, vision is reduced and in order to be safer drivers need to go slower. There are also many more cars on the road, as people who would normally bike either switch to driving their own car or riding the bus.\" In addition to having to drive much more attentively, drivers also face the challenge of increased ridership on buses. \"A lot of people who ride their bikes switch to alternative methods of getting around Davis on stormy days, and Unitrans is the alternative for a good number of people,\" Bizjak said via email. \"Our buses tend to be a lot more packed on rainy days as a result.\" Because of increased ridership, late and crowded buses are the most common complaints during rainy weather. Bizjak wants to assure riders that Unitrans does everything it can to keep the system running smoothly. \"When the weather is more severe we tend to get more concerns about lateness or being passed up at stops than in the more mild weather,\" Bizjak said via email. \"As mentioned before, the increased ridership and hazardous conditions tend to make our buses run late, and we are always very sorry to inconvenience our passengers who are trying to reach their destinations in a timely manner [ ] All of our drivers work hard to ensure we can provide safe transportation on a daily basis in rain or shine to the City of Davis.\" For Ariana Camarena, a first-year environmental policy major, the biggest challenge on stormy days is the decrease in morale to face the day. \"It usually just makes me want to stay in my dorm and not really go outside,\" Camarena said. \"Even though I do have class, I have to force myself to go. Whereas days where there is nice weather, I am kind of more encouraged to go because you can dress nice and look nice.\" Camarena\\'s experiences in the rain have taught her how to prepare for such weather. \"I have to wear a lot of layers: three layers of jackets, a scarf, an umbrella and my rain boots,\" Camarena said. \"It\\'s a lot more of a process. And you have to deal with locking your bike, so that takes like longer. It\\'s a hassle.\"': 33,\n",
       " u' Protesters demand that Trump, UC system support divestment of fossil fuels Approximately 30 protesters gathered at the Memorial Union flagpole on Monday Jan. 23 and marched through the Quad toward Mrak Hall to protest President Donald Trump\\'s climate denial and the university\\'s investments in fossil fuel. The protest included chants such as \"UC Davis not so cruel, we are still a fossil fuel,\" \"What do we want? Fossil freedom. When do we want it? Now\" and \"If we don\\'t get it, shut it down.\"  Sarah Risher, a third-year environmental policy analysis and planning major, stated that the protest was a way for students to demand that the University of California (UC) system stand up to Trump by fully divesting from fossil fuels and reinvesting that money into renewable energy sources. The protesters also demanded that the new chancellor openly and actively support fossil fuel divestment.  \"I think it was an important opt-out/teach in because today was a nationwide day of action and protest against Donald Trump\\'s climate denial,\" Risher said. \"In the face of an anti-science administration, we as a institution, world-renowned for our research and public service, have an ethical responsibility to divest.\" Many protesters emphasized that the UC should invest in sustainable opportunities to help students. \"Because we\\'re investing in our future by being here, the UC should invest in our future by altering our investment portfolio in a way that invests their money for a liveable future for students [ ] by ceasing to support companies that continue to pump CO2 in the atmosphere through the use of fossil fuels,\" said Nina Minaarasteh, a fourth-year communication and environmental policy analysis and planning double major. Kevin Horng, a fourth-year sustainable environmental design major and evolution, ecology and biodiversity minor, shared the same sentiments.': 34,\n",
       " u' Protesters gather at State Capitol Building for NODAPL rally \"Water is sacred, water is life,\" chanted hundreds of demonstrators in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline at the front of the State Capitol building in downtown Sacramento on Nov. 8. For the past several months, national attention has been drawn to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Thousands have traveled to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation to protest with the Sioux tribe, including Sophia Baker, one of the Sacramento rally organizers.   \"My cousin Lilly and I created the event on Facebook after my boyfriend and I came back from North Dakota,\" Baker said. \"We came back here and decided we needed to do something for people who can\\'t go out to North Dakota in California.\"  From there, they immediately went to work. Lilly Baker spearheaded the event by calling different local tribes and getting people to come together. The event also included guest speakers from the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians from Mendocino County and the Chippewa tribe, as well as a youth group that performed a tribal dance. According to Baker, the main objective was to bring the issue to a broader scale and make more people aware of the pipeline\\'s potential consequences. \\xa0 Initially, the pipeline was supposed to run through North Dakota\\'s capitol, Bismarck, The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deemed this pipeline option not viable and rerouted it to run through the land of the Sioux, who argue that this violates indigenous rights and several treaties. In fact, much of the controversy surrounding the pipeline centers around the right to clean water.  The pipeline runs beneath the Missouri River, the main water source for the tribe. Protesters argue that such a vital resource for life shouldn\\'t be put under such a large scale risk. Many also argue that if the pipeline were to have an accidental leak or rupture, the Sioux would be left without clean water for an extended period of time.  Priscilla Hunter of the Coyote Valley Band of Pomo Indians shares this fear. \"Indian people are getting tired. Enough is enough you know?\" Hunter said. \"Destroying our sacred lands, destroying the water and the environment, for our children, that could poison a lot of water and rivers.\" According to Hunter, 10 tribes in Mendocino County alone have passed resolutions to stop the pipeline. Efforts have reached people across the nation thanks to social media according to Fred Short, the American Indian spiritual leader for California. \"This is how information gets out,\" Short said. \"Now you can see on Facebook and the Internet you know, it\\'s all over with people putting out all the information. We have people here that are returning from Standing Rock, and they\\'ll be able to share some of that [ ] it\\'s no longer people standing still and saying nothing.\" The pipeline was expected to be completed by Jan. 2017, but protests could potentially cause this date to be moved later. As the issue gains more attention, more protests are organizing in local areas around the country in hopes of getting politicians to stand with Standing Rock.  \"We need to hold all of our politicians and all of our corporations accountable for what they\\'re doing to people and their right to clean water,\" Baker said in a closing remark at the event. \"There\\'s no politics involved in it, it\\'s literally people\\'s right to clean water that we\\'re trying to get people to focus on. If they can do it in North Dakota, they can do it anywhere.\" \\xa0': 109,\n",

       " u' Recent report finds that many other California counties rates also higher Yolo County\\'s poverty rate remains higher than before 2007, prior to the onset of the Great Recession, according to a new report issued by the California Budget & Policy Center from the beginning of this year This report, titled \"Few California Communities Have Fully Made Up Ground Lost Due to the Great Recession,\" used the U.S. Census Bureau\\'s official poverty measure to determine its findings.  The report concluded that in Yolo County alone, more than 18 percent of individuals were living in poverty. The report also looked specifically at childhood poverty rates. It found that there was an increase in poverty rates by nearly 3 percentage points between 2007 to 2015, with about 17 percent of children living in poverty in 2015.  For the greater Sacramento region, three other counties rates remain higher, occurring in Placer, Sacramento and Sutter counties. Not only are the surrounding region\\'s poverty rates higher than before 2007, but so are 26 other counties rates across California. Kings, Madera and Sutter counties were found to have the highest recorded poverty rates from 2015 figures, with more than 8 percentage points higher than 2007s numbers.  These high rates of poverty seen across the state and our country indicate issue\\'s seriousness. Every year, millions of California residents alone cannot adequately support themselves and their families. High housing costs, the lack of affordable child care available and low-wage jobs are a few main reasons why individuals may be struggling to get by.  \"For a family of four with two adults and two children, the official poverty threshold was $24,036 in 2015,\" stated the Supplemental Poverty Measure: 2015 Report by the US Census Bureau.  In specific, children of color are hit hard by higher levels of poverty; Black and Latino children are about three times more likely to live in poverty than white children. Policy analysts suggest that by increasing the incomes of low-earning families to a living wage, these families struggling to get by will be able to provide better for themselves and their children.  \"In California, two-thirds of the people living under the poverty line are working. It is critical that we make sure those people working having a living minimum wage,\" said Steven Bliss, the director of strategic communications at the California Budget & Policy Center. ': 76,\n",
       " u' Recipients each rewarded $25,000 for research University News announced the names of the 11 Chancellor Fellows of 2016 on Jan. 24, allotting each the prestigious title and a generous $25,000 to further their research at UC Davis. With contributions to environmentally-friendly transportation, food health and sustainability, comprehension of cardiovascular disease, probate investigation and more, there are now 120 recipients of the award, which has been issued annually for the past 17 years.  \"I continue to be awestruck by the excellence and creativity of UC Davis faculty, and inspired by the brilliant leading-edge work they do, every day, in their teaching and research,\" said Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter to University News. \"I am honored to welcome this select group \\u2014 distinguished by especially high accomplishment \\u2014 to the ranks of the Chancellor\\'s Fellows.\" The following are the selected professors and their areas of study: Daniela Barile, Food Science and Technology; Amber Boydstun, Political Science; James Bremer, Mathematics; Nann Fangue, Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology; Bo Feng, Communication; Aldrin Gomes, Neurobiology, Physiology and Behavior; Yuming He, East Asian Languages and Cultures; David Horton, School of Law; Tina Jeoh, Biological and Agricultural Engineering; Alissa Kendall, Civil and Environmental Engineering and Emily Solari, School of Education. Since the majority of the fellows have been at UC Davis for fewer than five years, Vice Chancellor for Development and Alumni Relations Shaun Keister said that they have difficulty obtaining financial support for their research compared to more established faculty members. \"I was very happily surprised to receive [the honor],\" Kendall said. \"Most of the time our biggest struggle is to be able to pursue new areas of research, so once you have something going you can apply to get research grants.\" Keister said that the Davis Chancellor Club raises money through donations in order to provide the recipients with this endowment. \"It is a way to reward [newer faculty members] for early successes in their teaching career,\" Keister said. \"This gives them funding to really jumpstart the research that they\\'re doing.\" Though the number of fellows is not necessarily limited by the amount of funding, Keister said the office usually awards between nine and 11 professors per year. So far, the program has had remarkable results. \"Some of our most successful faculty members on this campus have gone on to do amazing things who were recipients 10 or 15 years ago,\" Keister said. Chancellor Fellows are nominated by deans and faculty, reviewed by a small committee of institution members and then sent to the chancellor for confirmation. The committee finalized the honorees in the fall and sent an email congratulating them in mid-December.  \"It was one of those things where you see an email in your inbox and [ ] you cannot possibly believe that it\\'s accurate,\" Horton said. A reception is planned for the spring, where fellows will have the opportunity to speak about their research and teaching experience thus far.': 12,\n",
       " u' Regents approve tuition increase in 16-4 vote The Regents of the University of California (UC) met at UC San Francisco at Mission Bay on Jan. 25 and 26, approving the first tuition increase for the UC system in six years. Although other business items were discussed at the meeting, tuition dominated the discussion. ASUCD President Alex Lee was present at the meeting to provide a public comment.  \"The reality is that these increases will not be moderate for us,\" Lee said. \"The Middle Class Scholarship is on the chopping block in the proposed state budget [ ] Too many students already skip meals or don\\'t buy necessary books to afford tuition or, even worse, may not be able to afford skyrocketing rents. We are facing a crisis of affordability.\" UC President Janet Napolitano, who was present at the meeting despite her recent hospitalization, explained that money for the UC must come from somewhere, but the state continues to not fully fund the system. \"We have done more with less, but at a cost: higher student-faculty ratios, fewer courses, fewer teaching assistants and student services that haven\\'t kept pace with student growth,\" Napolitano said. \"We are working hard to secure state funding and other sources of revenue that support growth.\" This growth includes large increases in enrollment throughout the UC system. \"This fall we enrolled 7,500 more California undergraduates than last year, the largest one year increase in resident enrollment since World War II,\" Napolitano said. \"This entering class is the most diverse ever and among the most accomplished academically. We are committed to another increase of 2,500 California students next year and 2,500 more the year after that.\" At the end of discussion, the board of regents voted to increase tuition by $336 per year: $282 in direct tuition increases and $54 for student fees. This will bring in-state tuition to $12,630. Out-of-state tuition was increased by an additional $1,688, raising it to $40,644. One of the four regents (out of 20) who voted against the tuition increase was Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom. During the debate, he specifically focused his criticism on the unwillingness of the state government to increase funding to the UC. \"I\\'m not going to vote against the budget [ ] I just don\\'t like the revenue proposals,\" Newsom said. \"By doing the legislature and the governor\\'s work by finding the revenue, we\\'ve let them off the hook [ ] They will see this as an effort not to do their work \\u2014 to find the $88 million [that are unfunded]. They don\\'t have to now.\" Before voting on the final budget, a motion to divide the approval of the budget into two motions took place: a first vote on increasing tuition, and then a second vote on the final budget. Under this motion, the budget could not be approved if tuition increases were blocked. The motion to divide the question failed in a 12-8 vote. In addition to Newsom, student Regent Marcela Ramirez, Assemblymember John P\\xe9rez and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson also voted against the tuition raise. The UC Regents also voted to approve a new professional school at UC Irvine \\u2014 the Sue and Bill Gross School of Nursing. In addition, P\\xe9rez was appointed as the new chair of the Academic and Student Affairs Committee.': 16,\n",
       " u' SR #7 asks university to increase capacity for future campus housing On Jan. 26, ASUCD passed a new resolution to submit comments on the Notice of Preparation for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR), the next phase for the UC Davis Long Range Development Plan (LRDP). Resolution #7, authored by Sara Williams, the External Affairs Commission chair, proposes a larger share of on campus housing than previously planned for the 2017-2027 plan. The resolution passed with a vote of 10-0-1, with Senator Shaitaj Dhaliwal abstaining. As required by the California Environmental Quality Act, the university released a Notice of Preparation, which allows for comments regarding the drafting of the EIR that will eventually be submitted. \"UC Davis requests input regarding the scope and content of the Draft EIR that is relevant to your agency\\'s statutory/regulatory responsibilities or is of interest to individuals, to ascertain potential environmental impacts of the project,\" the notice read. \"Responses to this NOP are requested to identify: 1) the significant environmental issues, reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures that should be explored in the Draft EIR; and 2) whether your agency will be a responsible or trustee agency for the project.\" The current LRPD includes plans to provide housing for 90 percent of enrollment growth and 40 percent of all Davis-based students by 2027-28. ASUCD, as well as the Davis City Council, which passed a concurrent resolution, proposes that the university revise those plans to be able to house 100 percent of enrollment growth and 50 percent of all Davis-based students. Ricardo Martinez, a fourth-year political science and philosophy double major and ASUCD senator, said that the 50/100 proposal will help students who are forced to search for housing outside of Davis. \"What the resolution says is that UC Davis should meet the 50 percent in-housing threshold for students so that we can accommodate more students here on campus to live here instead of having them go outside the city and not, you know, find any housing because right now vacancies are really low,\" Martinez said. \"So the City of Davis has a problem with housing and that in-turn affects students who often times can\\'t find a place to live and usually what they do is they go with friends or they live in Woodland and it\\'s just, it\\'s not a good mix when it comes to housing.\" UC Davis began planning the LRDP in the fall of 2015. After Feb. 17, the last day for individuals and government agencies to submit comments on the EIR, the university plans to draft the LRDP and EIR for public review in fall 2017. UC Davis will submit the finalized versions to the UC Regents for consideration in early 2018. ASUCD President Alex Lee, who signed off on the resolution, said that housing in Davis has become a major problem that needs further discussion before UC Davis can move forward with the 10 year plan. \"I definitely think that the issue of housing isn\\'t going away anytime soon,\" Lee said. \"The issue is just going to get worse and worse and by the time we see any construction start on the proposed LRDP, it\\'s going to be pretty bad by then. I think that the city and the campus need to do their part to provide housing for all of it\\'s population, of course the key demographic is students, who are the majority of both populations, of the city and of the campus.\" The City of Davis and the University have been in continuous discussion since LRDP planning began, although there hasn\\'t always been mutual agreement regarding the final steps. \"I think the relationship between the City of Davis and UC Davis is not that well and it\\'s not cohesive in terms of them having a mutual understanding,\" Martinez said. \"So I think there needs to be an improvement, especially by administration, to reach out to the City of Davis and the mayor, because the City of Davis has been reaching out to the administration, and they haven\\'t been that responsive. I think the resolution puts the administration on notice and lets them know that students are aware of the current issues that are going to affect them now and in the future, so I think it would be good for the administration to take student concerns into account moving forward in the next 10 years.\" ': 1,\n",

       " u' Some activists in favor of Yiannopoulos, others accuse speaker of fascism On Jan. 13, the controversial ultra-conservative speaker Milo Yiannopoulos was to speak at UC Davis as part of his \"The Dangerous Faggot Tour\" with guest pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli. The event, hosted by the Davis College Republicans (DCR), was subsequently cancelled 30 minutes prior to Yiannopoulos taking the stage due to mass protests outside of the Sciences Lecture Hall venue. Prior to the 7 p.m. start time of the event, a crowd of hundreds gathered to protest it. Many wore black handkerchiefs as face masks and held signs suggesting that Yiannopoulos and his fans were fascist and promoting hate speech. The protesters also chanted sayings such as \"No Milo, no KKK, no fascist USA,\" \"Say it loud say it clear, racists are not welcome here\" and \"This is what democracy looks like.\" Eggs were thrown during the protest and an ABC News cameraman reportedly had hot coffee thrown at him.  According to Yiannopoulos\\' Facebook page and the DCR, the violent nature of the protestors resulted in the event\\'s cancellation. However, the majority of those present at the event were nonviolent, and according to a statement released by Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, there was no property damage and only one individual was arrested.  The cancellation upset many who had planned to attend the event. \"It\\'s pretty upsetting that a group of people who claim to be anti-fascists are coming here to make sure no one can hear something,\" an individual waiting in line to see the event said. \"I hope they see the irony in that. I went up towards the door just to see what was going on. I was wearing my [Make America Great Again] hat, someone stole it off my head and shoved me in the back, when I turned around they were sprinting away. I guess the key to stopping fascism is blocking people\\'s speech and petty theft [ ] I enjoy Milo, I enjoy the free speech aspect. I think it\\'s a lot of fun, and I came to be informed and be entertained.\" Other types of protests were also present at the event. One activist group stood in a line adjacent to the Sciences Lecture Hall holding signs that promoted love to minority groups. This protest was nonviolent and instead hoped to offer support to those that would feel targeted by Yiannopoulos\\' talk. \"We are protesting Milo Yiannopoulos being here and giving him the platform that comes with a prestigious university,\" said Christina, a UC Santa Cruz alumna. \"He obviously says things that he\\'s allowed to say. Freedom of speech, totally! But that does not mean freedom from consequences. I think he does hate speech, I think [his words] are very violent and words matter and they have a huge impact. I think allowing him to be here is making the students unsafe.\" Additionally a third protest outside of the Sciences Lecture Hall was in favor of allowing Yiannopoulos to speak. These individuals held signs that read, \"Protect free speech even \\'hate\\' speech,\" and promoted preserving Yiannopoulos\\' event for the sake of allowing freedom of speech. \"Well I heard that Milo was coming and I\\'ve seen him at other universities and the reaction that it gets,\" said activist Ani Zickuh. \"There\\'s been times where he\\'s had to cancel events so I wanted to show up and support [Yiannopoulos] because I think it\\'s important to have different viewpoints, especially on a campus with learning because it opens discussion and encourages free thinking. [ ] Honestly I don\\'t agree with a lot of what he says, but I can only say that because I\\'ve actually listened to him.\" On Jan. 14, Yiannopoulos and the DCR held a protest against the event being cancelled, claiming that it was due to pressure from the university.  UC Davis received considerable media attention from Yiannopoulos\\' visit. The story was picked up by local news stations including The Sacramento Bee, the L.A. Times and the front page of Internet forum site, Reddit. ': 43,\n",

       " u' Speakers CeCe McDonald and Franchesca Ramsey keynote the event Internet personality Franchesca Ramsey and Black Trans Lives Matter activist CeCe McDonald were the headliners of \"Change/The Conversation,\" a speaking event hosted on Jan. 13, the same day as an event scheduled by the UC Davis College Republicans featuring Breitbart tech editor Milo Yiannopoulos. The event was held in the Activities and Recreation Center (ARC) Ballroom and was organized by Sam Alavi, a fourth-year sociology major. Ramsey is a South Florida native and currently lives in New York. She is an active YouTube personality and host for MTV. \"I originally went to the University of Michigan for acting, but after my sophomore [year] transferred to the art institute in Miami Florida and got my BFA in graphic design,\" Ramsey said via e-mail. \"Today I\\'m a writer, actor and video blogger in addition to hosting and producing the MTV News web series \\'Decoded.\"\\' McDonald is a community activist who, according to Alavi, brings important conversation about black lives, transgender lives and America\\'s prison system to campus. \"I think we lack conversations about black trans women and trans women in general on our campus, so it seemed like a great opportunity to bring her because she brings a great perspective about transgender identities, around race [and] around the intersection of the prison-industrial complex,\" Alavi said. Ramsey said that she planned to bring information about her career and social media to the UC Davis campus. \"I think more activists should be transparent about their mistakes and things they\\'ve learned during their careers,\" Ramsey said via e-mail. \"Unfortunately there seems to be a trend of activists using their platforms solely to shame and dig up dirt on others. While I think it\\'s important to call out problematic people and behaviors as they happen, we have to remember we all started somewhere and unfortunately many people in these spaces present themselves as \\'perfect\\' rather than humans who\\'re constantly in need of self reflection.\" According to Alavi, a \"perfect storm\" of events set the stage for \"Change/The Conversation.\" \"There was this perfect storm of events where there was Martin Luther King weekend, Milo [Yiannopoulos] was coming, there has been a lot of tension on campus [and] there has been a lot of discussion about wanting to host an event,\" Alavi said. \"I reached out to a ton of people and I asked all these different students, \\'If we were going to have an event, who would you want to see?\\' And overwhelmingly people said CeCe McDonald and Franchesca Ramsey.\" Alavi said that one of the goals of the event organizers was to bring the event and the ideas discussed to more than just students and faculty of the university. \"We [wanted] to reach a broad audience [ ] I think there [were] kind of two points to the event: one [was] to create a community space where students who aren\\'t necessarily hearing this for the first time [ ] can hear their experiences confirmed and validated by other people, but I think the other aspect [was] we want people who don\\'t necessarily know everything about social justice [ ] that they come hear it and get this other perspective too,\" Alavi said. According to Jeanelle Hope, an emcee for \"Change/The Conversation\" and a cultural studies graduate student, McDonald and Ramsey brought knowledge about racial intolerance to campus. \"McDonald and Ramsey, both social justice warriors and advocates, will certainly bring forth a stimulating discussion addressing: how white supremacy and bigotry cannot be tolerated, how we must collectively work to dismantle systems of oppression and to remind us no matter how dark the future may look, that we matter and that we must resist and dissent for the sake of our existence,\" Hope said via e-mail before the event. While this event was the same night as the Yiannopoulos event, Alavi explained that her concern with the Yiannopoulos event was less with the speaker and more with the interest from students. Alavi hoped that her event would be an \"alternative space\" for students that night. \"Personally as a student, I am less concerned about Milo [Yiannopoulos ] and more concerned that we have students on campus who want to come hear him speak,\" Alavi said. \"I think that indicates to me a failure in our education system to teach [about] sexism and racism, homophobia and transphobia and how to identify it and be critical of it. [Our event is] for students who want an alternative space. Not that it should happen instead of Milo\\'s event, but that we can have this dialogue and those that want to hear it can hear it.\"': 44,\n",
       " u' Speakers criticize \"unconstitutional\" system On Nov. 19, the Davis Vanguard hosted its annual fundraiser for its nonprofit court watch organization which monitors malpractice in local courts. This year\\'s event focused on bail reform. Guest speakers included\\xa0Equal Justice Under the Law director Phil Telfeyan and San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi.  David Greenwald, editor and founder of the Davis Vanguard, was one of the key organizers of the event. The event helped to secure funding for the Davis Vanguard for the rest of 2016. According to Greenwald, tickets sold out quickly, and there were over 200 attendees, all interested in hearing about the reform movement. \"We have an annual event on a variety of different topics, [but] this is the first time we\\'ve done bail reform.\" Greenwald said. \"[This] has been an issue that has kind of just been below the surface [ ] there\\'s a huge fairness factor involved in bail reform that people that can\\'t afford to get out on bail end up staying in custody and suffer a whole bunch of consequences for staying in custody. It\\'s not based on what most people think, which is risks to society, it\\'s just based on their ability to pay.\" Jeff Adachi is a well-known advocate for bail reform and was pleased to be able to highlight his cause to a new audience. \"It\\'s an issue that\\'s very dear to my heart,\" Adachi said. \"I believe that bail reform is one of the most critical issues in terms of ensuring that people are treated fairly. We have a system in the United States which keeps people detained because they don\\'t have enough money to post bail. It\\'s fundamentally unfair.\"  Adachi is confident that actual reform will take place soon and hopes to replace the system with alternatives used by many other countries. \"I would like to see a non-monetary bail system,\" Adachi said. \"[There are] only two countries in the world that allow a profit generating business to help with bail, and that\\'s the United States and the Philippines. There will be a bail reform bill this year, the city attorney and the sheriff has said that they believe that bail is unconstitutional, so there you have the party that normally would defend this saying that it\\'s indefensible.\"  One recent initiative to address some of the ethical issues surrounding bail took place in Santa Clara County. The initiative, drawn up and approved by the Santa Clara Board of Supervisors, removed bail requirements for specific types of low level crimes. Although the measure was approved, it still faces heavy opposition from the bail bond industry and has yet to be fully implemented. In an interview with CBS KPIX news anchor Len Ramirez, LaDoris Cordell, a retired judge and legal analyst in Santa Clara County, highlighted the reform as a big step in the right direction. \"The bail reform initiated in Santa Clara County is huge, it\\'s a big deal,\" Cordell said in the interview. \"In fact, it is a game changer. The bail system has been discriminating against poor people, many of whom are people of color. What Santa Clara County has done is turn that upside down.\" Despite successes in places like Santa Clara, Adachi knows that the system will not to change overnight. He views present legislation, such as a pro-reform bill introduced by California State Assemblyman Rob Bonta, as evidence that the country is moving in the right direction. \"We\\'re [ ] seeing [ ] a huge push to change the bail system once and for all,\" Adachi said. \"It will be slow because it\\'s state by state, but it is going to happen.\"': 93,\n",
       " u' Speakers, including Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, highlight dangers of executive orders for the campus community In a packed main lobby of the UC Davis International Center, UC Davis Global Affairs hosted a discussion on Feb. 2 concerning President Donald Trump\\'s executive orders on immigration.  This order, one of the more infamous of the ones President Trump has signed thus far, bans travel of persons from seven Muslim-majority nations. However, it remains blocked after the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to reinstate it on Feb. 9, according to The New York Times. Joanna Regulska, vice provost and associate chancellor for Global Affairs, opened the discussion. She claimed that these executive orders go against national and campus values. \"Recent events in [the] US political arena [have] really challenged our core values \\u2014 values of inclusion and respect for all, regardless of the gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age and many, many other identity markings,\" Regulska said. \"Three recently signed executive orders [are] especially challenging these values. They all are related to immigration and they will strongly affect our community.\" Apart from attacking values, Regulska spoke about the effects that these orders have on the campus community and the free exchange of ideas. \"These three executive orders not only made an effort to undermine our values, they [ ] attempt to destroy our community fabric,\" Regulska said. \"They also attack American higher education systems. They will deny to many US students the opportunity to learn about different cultures and ideas. They do this by limiting their opportunities to engage with international students on our campus.\" Interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter, who was present at the event, posed a question to the audience when he spoke. \"Why are so many who aren\\'t directly afflicted by the order experiencing anger and sadness?\" Hexter asked the audience, according to UC Davis Dateline. \"Part of the answer, I believe, is those feelings are the inevitable products of empathy for those who are \\u2014 and a belief in the value and dignity of all people, regardless of their background. Indeed, it\\'s difficult not to be deeply affected when one considers the plight of refugees, most of them women or children, whose great suffering and hardship has been followed by denial of entry into the United States.\" One campus resource that has been very active in the aftermath of Trump\\'s executive order is the UC Undocumented Legal Services Center. Serving the whole UC system apart from UC Berkeley, the center is hosted by the UC Davis School of Law. Rachel Ray, managing attorney for the center, explained that the services the center provides are open not just to students, but to students\\' families as well. \"Our center provides immigration legal services to all UC students who are not international students,\" Ray said at the event according to UC Davis Dateline. \"Our target audience [is] undocumented students, but that does not preclude students who are not international but who are lawful permanent residents or [who are] here through some other method \\u2014 they can contact us [ ] And our services are also available to immediate family members of any student, so if you\\'re a US citizen and you have a parent, a sibling, a child, a spouse or an immediately future spouse, you can contact us and we may be able to provide legal services to that family member.\" While the immediate response to the order has been strong as the it faces court challenges and skepticism, Regulska also emphasized the possible lasting effects of the order. \"In the long run, this culture of isolationism produces unwarranted suspicion, promotes violence and makes us all less secure,\" Regulska said. Regulska, a Polish immigrant, explained that these executive orders have impacted her personally.': 3,\n",
       " u' Student protesters march from MU flagpole to Mrak Hall UC Davis students and community members protested the installation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) on Thursday, Feb. 2. The protest was part of a larger scale UC-wide day of action, demanding that the UC regents divest from Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, two fossil fuel corporations involved in the construction of the DAPL.  The students met at the Memorial Union \\xa0flagpole and marched through the Coffee House and Shields Library before heading to Mrak Hall. Led by UC Davis campus organizer Francisco Ferreyra, protesters held signs to demonstrate their solidarity with indigenous people and their land claims.  Ferreyra, a third-year regional and community development major and environmental sustainability officer at the UC Student Association, said the protest was organized so the community could stand up against the fossil fuel industry\\'s project, which may compromise clean water supply in Native American reservations. \"This pipeline will leak, as all pipelines do, and when it does it will potentially contaminate drinking water for 18 million Americans that depend on the Missouri River,\" Ferreyra said. \"And if this black snake is completed it will send a message to the country that the U.S. government cares more about corporate profits than the treaties it signed with Native Americans years ago.\" The pipeline\\'s potential detrimental effects on the surrounding environment are not the only reason why students protested. Last month, it was reported that the University of California Retirement Plan, managed by the Office of the Chief Investment Officer of the Regents, currently holds bonds in Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics.  \"It doesn\\'t make sense for one of the leading climate science institutions in America to invest in an industry that is killing the earth,\" said Hanna Presiado, a first-year environmental science and management major.  With President Donald Trump\\'s executive order last month advancing the approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, as he promised during his campaign, some students feel that the current administration\\'s stance on environmental policy does not reflect the will of the people and will be detrimental for future generations.  Josh Wertheim, a third-year anthropology major who participated in the protests at Standing Rock in North Dakota, expressed his concern for the environment and the pipeline\\'s impact on future generations. \"This is our world and we borrow the world from the future,\" Wertheim said.  The appointment of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State has also riled supporters of environmental sustainability.': 5,\n",
       " u' Students promote fruit and vegetable meals via social media  The Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS) hosted the \"Step Up to the Plate\" campaign on campus from Jan. 23-27 in order to encourage students to fill half of their plates with fruits and vegetables. The campaign, which was run by the Health Education and Promotion department within the SHCS, included outreach events such as tabling at the Student Community Center and the Activities and Recreation Center to give out free bananas and oranges to students.  Based on the latest American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment, a research survey about college student wellness, less than 6 percent of undergrads and 10 percent of graduate students consume five or more servings of fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. The campaign\\'s goal was to increase that percentage and to educate students about the health benefits of consuming more fruits and vegetables daily.  The campaign slogan was \"Step Up to the Plate. Make 1/2 Your Plate Fruits and Veggies.\" The hashtag #aggieplate was used throughout the campaign to prompt students to post photos of their plates filled halfway with fruits and vegetables. A winner was drawn and awarded a $10 ASUCD CoHo gift card. Daisy Valdez, a health education and promotion wellness student assistant who worked on the campaign, believes that students learned an important message from the campaign.  \"I believe students gained a reminder of the importance of eating more fruits and vegetables as well as learned about easy ways to increase their consumption of fruits and veggies\" Valdez said. \"Making half your plate fruits and veggies is such a simple way to increase the amount you are eating, so we received positive feedback from students about using it as a tool. One of the highlights of this campaign was the fresh fruit giveaways. Students were pleasantly surprised to receive free fruit.\" Stephanie Goley, a fourth-year science and technology major, likes eating fruit and is happy it is offered on campus.  \"I particularly like berries,\" Goley said. \"Specifically blueberries and raspberries because they are rich in antioxidants.\"  Yosenia Ruiz, a first-year biology major, likes how many healthy promotions and options UC Davis offers and is happy knowing there was a campaign encouraging students to eat healthier.  \"It can be really easy to just choose the cheap, fast and fattening food option, especially in college when you are on a tight budget,\" Ruiz said. \"I have the dining commons where I still get a lot of food options but once I move out I need to find resources like this one that can provide for me healthy options.\" ': 10,\n",
       " u' Students respond to termination of UC tuition freeze On Monday, Nov. 21, approximately 30 students gathered at the Memorial Union and marched through the Coffee House to Mrak Hall from 12 to 1 p.m. to protest potential UC tuition hikes.  The protest, which was advertised in a Facebook event for UC Davis students, was inspired by the UCSB Student Activist Network\\'s own tuition protest. \"Two years ago, the UC tried to increase tuition across the board [by 5 percent] every year for the following five years,\" the Santa Barbara Student Activist Network stated on Facebook. \"After students mobilized, the UC instituted a tuition freeze for in-state, undergraduate students. That tuition freeze is now over, which means it\\'s time, once again, to mobilize.\" The UCSB Student Activist Network called for UC students to get involved in the tuition hike protests. \"We need to show the UC administration that students will not settle for another partial tuition freeze, but demand a rollback on tuition,\" the UCSB Student Activist Network said. \"The UC Administration, the UC Regents and the State of California need to prove that they prioritize students by addressing the structural problems faced when funding the UC.\" UC Davis students participated in the walk-out with chants such as \"Hey hey UCD, no more tuition fees,\" \"Education is a right, and so we\\'re gonna fight\" and \"Hey hey, ho ho, tuition hikes have got to go.\" Dexter Hampton, a first-year environmental science major, believes that the tuition surges are absurd, especially since he is already paying a significantly higher amount as an out-of-state student. \"I came here from Ohio and what do I get? $40,000 a year in tuition,\" Hampton said. \"I\\'m going to be in debt the rest of my life trying to fix the problems that these bastards are creating.\" Once the protesters made it to Mrak Hall, students spoke to the group about how administrators have large salaries while students work hard to afford college. Demonstrators chanted: \"Hey, hey UCD, cut those admin salaries\" and \"Your paychecks are big, your brains are small, your ivory tower soon will fall.\" Matthew Bridges, a third-year transfer ecologic management and restoration major who participated in the protest, suggested students write a letter to campus administrators informing them of student frustrations regarding inflated tuition rates. \"I\\'m here because I don\\'t think the university should be increasing tuition when there\\'s a lot of other inefficiencies in the system that could be cut,\" Bridges said. \"The students shouldn\\'t be the ones who are taking that burden, especially if they have to take on debt.\" Bridges said that, although the protest was not well-organized and had an ambiguous message, it is important for all students to express their opinion on the tuition issue. \"The fact that we made our presence [known] and there were high-level people walking around [Mrak Hall], to see us [ ] was effective,\" Bridges said. Students who participated in the walk-out plan to protest further moving forward to ensure that their voices are heard.': 57,\n",
       " u' Students, activists call for solidarity with Standing Rock As blue and red police lights wailed through the air in downtown Davis, dozens laid at the intersection of 2nd Street in Downtown Davis in protest. Chants calling for action against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) invaded the unsettling stillness of the bodies. Thus, on Nov. 21, Davis became one of many cities across the country to support with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Water is sacred; water is life \\u2014 this is the repeated phrase of the Standing Rock Tribe in North Dakota, which for months has adamantly protested the installation of an oil pipeline. The tribe claims that the pipeline not only violates native land rights, but that it also threatens the local drinking water supply.  The pipeline itself is planned to run across four states, but it is the part of the pipeline\\'s journey across the Missouri River in particular that has caused protests to erupt across the country.  Francisco Ferraya, a third-year transfer community and regional development major and organizer of the downtown Davis NoDAPL protest, argued that the DAPL is not just a matter of access to clean drinking water, but an issue of civil rights for Native Americans. \"[This pipeline] represents more than just another fossil fuel contract,\" Ferraya said. \"This is really the culmination of 500 years of cultural genocide and historical erasure. It\\'s the most important battle right now, I think, against capitalism, against American imperialism and against fossil fuels.\" The DAPL was previously planned to be routed just north of Bismarck, N.D. but was rerouted after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deemed its planned location a potential contaminant to Bismarck\\'s water supply. Now, Standing Rock faces a similar dilemma, but with a different response.   \"[The protesters] were attacked [a few] nights ago, with a super high-powered hose in like, 20-degree weather, and pepper spray and mace,\" Ferraya said.  Ferraya is no stranger to the violence surrounding NoDAPL protests, having recently been to North Dakota to join the Standing Rock tribe.  \"I went about a week after the video surfaced where the water protectors were attacked by dogs,\" Ferraya said. \"It was really powerful because folks were there just days after the dogs had attacked them, so I saw the wounds with my own eyes.\" The protest in downtown Davis was one of many across the country, including a recent protest in Sacramento.  According to the official Stand with Standing Rock website, \"The Oceti Sakowin Camp represents a first of its kind historic gathering of Indigenous Nations. The most recent such assembly of Tribes occurred when the Great Sioux Nation gathered before the Battle at the Little Big Horn.\" Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company in charge of the development and implementation of the DAPL, recently engaged in a merger with Sunoco Logistics, another pipeline operating company. ETP is anxious to carry on with the project.  \"Dakota Access has been waiting long enough to complete this pipeline,\" said Kelcy Warren, the chief executive officer of ETP, in a previous interview.  Davis City Council previously passed a resolution stating that it supports with Standing Rock. Resolution 16-XXX, Series 2016 cites both the environmental tragedy that such a pipeline would pose and the adverse effects the pipeline would pose on the Standing Rock Sioux tribe: \"Now, therefore, be it resolved that the City Council of the City of Davis, stands in support of the opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline process and project and calls on all residents of Davis to raise awareness about this important struggle for Indigenous sovereignty and environmental justice and to support the Sacred Stones Camp\\'s efforts.\" \\xa0': 98,\n",
       " u' The City of Davis hosts festivities in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day On the morning of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, the City of Davis gathered to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Dr. King.  The 23rd annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration was presented by the Davis Human Relations Commision and the City of Davis. According to its website, the Davis Human Relations Commission works to \"build a community where relationship among diverse peoples are valued by all, discrimination and hate are not tolerated, the voices of the voiceless are heard.\" \\xa0 Members from all over the Davis community were invited to gather for this annual event. The festivities began at the Varsity Theater located in downtown Davis, where Mayor Robb Davis welcomed the community to the event. \"It\\'s an honor for us as a city to be able to host people from Davis and beyond to this event,\" Davis said. A keynote address was presented by Garth Lewis, an educator for the past 22 years and assistant superintendent of instructional services for the Yolo County Office of Education. \\xa0 In his keynote address, Lewis highlighted Dr. King\\'s beliefs in light of the bigotry seen in today\\'s political environment. \"Today\\'s theme, [Justice Everywhere:] Speaking Up for JUSTICE in a Climate of Intolerance, is a very appropriate call to action,\" Lewis said. \"For, when freedom and justice are taken for granted, they are threatened. These basic human rights are vulnerable to be abused by those with power with impunity. In the words of Dr. King, \\'Injustice anywhere, is a threat to justice everywhere.\\'\" Readings from the Parents of African American Children Davis Group and music by Marque Cass, Aleta Simone and the Davis Freedom Singers were also featured at the event. The event closed with the Davis Freedom Singers leading attendees in a symbolic \"Freedom March\" through downtown Davis, ending at the E Street Plaza. Participants performed classic peace and freedom songs throughout the concluding march. The event was recorded by the Davis Media Access and video can be found on its website.  \\xa0': 70,\n",
       " u' The Davis Manor Neighborhood hosts first Holiday Bazaar, opens new Little Free Library The Davis Manor Neighborhood (DMN) celebrated its first Holiday Bazaar on Saturday, Dec. 17, due to the efforts of the entire Davis Manor community. Residents of Davis Manor brought the community together before the business of holiday festivities.   \"Neighbors appreciated seeing the [diverse] talents and services people have to offer in our neighborhood. It\\'s good to know who likes to bake, who is good at canning, who sews clothing, who collects antiques, who offers massage or chiropractic services, who operates photo booths for parties, because then we can go to people right in your neighborhood when we need goods, services or advice,\" said Jennifer Nachmanoff, a member of the Davis Manor Creative Action Team and the main orchestrator of the Holiday Bazaar. Previously, DMN came together to create one of its first community street murals, which is located at the intersection of M and Duke Streets.  \"There has been a big effort in our neighborhood over the past few years to find ways to bring neighbors together and create a vibrant, connected community in a neighborhood that is somewhat lacking in city amenities, common green spaces and places to gather casually,\" Nachmanoff said.  The bazaar is not the first time DMN has organized community events. \\xa0 \"This was a sort of extension of the [monthly] Happy-ness Hours,\" Nachmanoff said. \"It was sunny, chilly, windy, but definitely happy. The opening of our Little Free Library in Colgate added to the community excitement and festive feeling.\"  On the same afternoon as the bazaar, DMN opened a Little Free Library through community donations and inspiration drawn from the street mural around the corner from the new Little Free Library.   \\xa0\"Davis Manor Neighborhood had been having visioning workshops for residents to explore what our neighborhood can do to connect with each other and make it visually beautiful,\" said Laurie Loving, key organizer of the Little Free Library and DMN resident. \"After a couple of meetings we had a design and began collecting donated materials. Many neighbors brought books and the corner nursery donated gardening books.\"  Loving and her husband, Russell, volunteered to have the Little Free Library integrated into their property. It was placed on their garden at the end of their driveway, next to the sidewalk. \\xa0 Neighbors contributed by donating the initial books that would be stored into the Little Free Library. One unique feature installed into the Little Free Library allows neighbors to interchange fruit and vegetable seeds through a seed drawer. ': 90,\n",
       " u' The Ukulele Kids Club donates instruments to UC Davis Children\\'s Hospital What started off as one man\\'s hope to provide community service has expanded into a volunteer organization that fundraises to send ukuleles to children\\'s hospitals. Corey Bergman, founder of Ukulele Kids Club Inc., was inspired to help others through music \\u2014 one of his passions \\u2014 after the loss of his son.  Bergman began volunteering at Nicklaus Children\\'s Hospital and Joe DiMaggio Children\\'s Hospital in 2012. A year later, he received the President\\'s Volunteer Service Award from former President Barack Obama. In 2014, he and his wife founded the Ukulele Kids Club Inc., a nonprofit organization that aims to aid music therapy in children\\'s hospitals by providing them with ukuleles. Initially, bigger cities and hospitals were identified for ukulele donation, but requests began rolling in from all across the country and world. The club transformed into something much bigger and more powerful, yet manages to stay close to its roots. \"Music therapy is utilizing music, music techniques and music interventions to achieve non-musical goals,\" said Stephanie Epstein, a board-certified music therapist at the Holtz Children\\'s Hospital and Jackson Pediatric Center. \"Goals can include improving speech and language skills, physical [and] motor skills, cognitive abilities, emotional expression and coping, and interpersonal skills.\" Epstein first met Bergman in the fall of 2014 when she was working at the Jackson Pediatric Center, a Pediatric Prescribed Extended Care (PPEC) facility. After further communication regarding music therapy, Bergman appointed Epstein as the Ukulele Kids Club music therapy advisor. Since its start just a few years ago, the organization has grown significantly by means of social media coverage and fundraising. \"We have donated to a little more than 150 pediatric hospitals. Eight or nine of those are in the UK, five or six in Canada, and the rest in the US. We will be approaching 3,000 instruments by February,\" \\xa0Bergman said. \"It\\'s hard to put into words \\u2014 it has a physical, mental, [and] emotional effect.\" Board-certified music therapists at various hospitals select children to receive instruments as Bergman tries to fulfill the many requests for the donation of ukuleles. Although only five ukuleles are shipped to hospitals at a time, some hospitals have received multiple shipments over the years. The UC Davis Children\\'s Hospital has been one of many to receive ukuleles from the Ukulele Kids Club. The hospital has been the recipient of several shipments since April of 2015, when it was one of the first of 10 hospitals to be a beneficiary. \"In the hospital, music therapy helps to reduce anxiety and help kids cope with being in the hospital,\" said Tori Steeley, music therapist at the UC Davis Children\\'s Hospital. \"It\\'s using specific music interventions that are created for each individual.\" Steeley is a full-time music therapist, who came into contact with the Ukulele Kids Club through another music therapist. She studied music performance in college and wished to continue with music by empowering others. \"[The Ukulele Kids Club] helps kids cope with being in the hospital by giving them something to do here,\" Steeley said. \"That could be combatting boredom, but music provides an outlet for them [the kids] to express themselves without having to use words.\" The Ukulele Kids Club receives donations from fundraising and is looking for corporate sponsors. All fundraising occurs on a personal level, as it is a nonprofit organization. There are hundreds of volunteers involved across the country \\u2014 a number that is expected to increase as the organization receives more publicity.': 75,\n",
       " u' The Yolo County Children\\'s Alliance celebrates its 10th annual giveaway event The Yolo County Children\\'s Alliance (YCCA) held its 10th Annual West Sacramento Giveaway Day at Westfield Village Elementary School in West Sacramento on Nov. 19. In addition to the items that were given away to families in need, the spirit of giving brought the Yolo County community together  YCCA is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to offering support services to families, addressing community concerns and gathering information on the well-being of families in Yolo County, which includes Davis, Woodland, Clarksburg, West Sacramento and Capay.  This year marked the 10th anniversary of the YCCA\\'s Annual Giveaway Day and would not have been possible without the assistance or funding from the entire community. Katie Villegas, executive director of the Yolo County Children\\'s Alliance, believes that YCCA goes above and beyond with this kind of distribution.  \"We do the food distribution, we do coats and blankets, household items and toys for kids. We extended our food distribution to include all of that. We usually raise 10,000 dollars for the event and serve about 500 families,\" Villegas said With the winter season fast approaching, YCCA made it this year\\'s goal to extend the number of coats that are donated.  \"We realized that there are a lot of kids without coats in West Sacramento,\" Villegas said. \"It was a big deal. We had limited the distribution to two per family before and this year we went up to three. We definitely ran out of coats. We had a lot of donations \\u2014 we probably had more than 15,000 coats and we ran out so it went really fast.\" For next year, the YCCA seeks to build upon this year\\'s accomplishments. Special projects manager, Julie Beckner concludes that one improvement that could be made for next year is the number of families that the YCCA is able to serve.  \"We were limited in how many families we were able to serve and the capacity in which we were able to serve them by the amount of money we had to buy the goods [ ] As always, more money means more capacity to help,\" Beckner said.  Villegas said that community should get involved in order to help those in need, and also because the event itself is enjoyable for people of all ages.  \"We love when people volunteer,\" Villegas said. \"Last year we had so many people volunteer, we had to go to an online registration [ ] This year we limited it to 16 and above, just because it is kind of hard with so many families coming through to have the younger kids there [ ] But I say if people want to volunteer for next year, to sign up early. They can follow us on Facebook or they can look at our [YCCA] website. We begin recruiting volunteers anywhere from six weeks to two months in advance and we fill up.\"  \\xa0': 97,\n",
       " u' The Yolo County community comes together for holiday food distribution The Yolo Food Bank (YFB) provides meals and adequate food for individuals year-round in an effort to address food insecurity in Yolo County. Currently, YFB is gearing up for the 2016 holiday season with its Yolo County holiday food distribution throughout the month of November and a Thanksgiving fundraising event, the Running of the Turkey\\'s 5k Run & Walk. YFB is the largest food relief organization in Yolo County. It is able to provide service to the community to address hunger in a number of different ways. Through its partnerships with over 60 nonprofits, like food kitchens and health clinics throughout the area,it is able to provide food to those in need. Additionally, through various direct distribution programs like its emergency food assistance program and its holiday meals distribution program, members of the organization are able to address different needs and serve diverse populations in the community.  \"[Food insecurity] affects a wide variety [of individuals ] We see working families, single adults, students, seniors and more,\" said Stephanie Villegas, the director of programs for the YFB. She added that food insecurity weighs heavily on a large population of children throughout the county. About 10,000 children in Yolo County may be food insecure at any given time; also, some 31,000 adults, nearly 15 percent of the population, may experience food insecurity. The annual report, Hunger in America 2014: Report for Food Bank of Yolo County, \\xa0describes that being food secure occurs when \"all people at all times can access enough food for an active, healthy life.\" However, many individuals and families living throughout the county who are food insecure do not know when their next meal is coming.  Luckily, there are food programs in place that can directly address hunger issues in the region. Take the holiday meals distribution event put together by the YFB that provides Thanksgiving meal kits for local families in Yolo County. YFB estimates that 2,000 meals will be provided this upcoming holiday season bringing local businesses, volunteers and families together. The Davis Food Co-op, a locally-run grocery store in downtown Davis, donated funds for nearly 250 to 300 turkeys for families in Davis this year.  \"We designate a certain amount to this program to the YFB for turkeys, and they depend on us,\" said Lis Harvey, the marketing director at the Davis Food Co-op.  Because Harvey sees the daily negative effects of food insecurity on the community, she and others at the Co-op, were determined to do what they could to help at this time. Donating funds for turkeys to the YFB seemed to be the best way to do so.  She added that shareholders and customers of the Co-op are also active contributors towards the cause. At their checkout registers, customers are able to specifically donate money toward turkey purchases to the YFB, and Harvey notices that people are taking the initiative to help one another.  \"We have generous shoppers, and we have the most generous community here in Davis [ ] Our customers appreciate donating money that goes directly to people in Yolo County,\" Harvey said. \\xa0': 110,\n",
       " u' The first endowed brewer will be Joe Williams Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. owners Ken Grossman and Katie Gonser gave $2 million to support UC Davis\\' brewing science program. The brewing programs at UC Davis are the only North American programs accredited by the Institute of Brewing & Distilling in London.  The individual selected as Sierra Nevada\\'s endowed brewer will be assisting in course instruction, maintaining the campus brewery and its equipment and mentoring and leading students and teaching assistants. The first endowed brewer will be Joe Williams, who currently serves as a staff researcher for UC Davis. He will serve as a liaison to the brewing industry for UC Davis and a host for visitors to the campus brewery.  Charlie Bamforth, a professor of food science and an Anheuser-Busch endowed professor of malting and brewing sciences, spoke highly of the Sierra Nevada position. \"We are thrilled to have received this wonderful gift from Ken Grossman and his wife Katie Gonser,\" Bamforth said via email. \"The Sierra Nevada Brewing Company endowed brewer is at the heart of our mission. Joe Williams, the campus brewer, plays a critical role in ensuring that the students emerging through the program have a thorough understanding of the complex practicalities of making beer.\" UC Davis and Sierra Nevada Brewing have a history with one another. Grossman lectures three times each year in the Introduction to Beer and Brewing course and often hosts Bamforth and his students for tours of the Sierra Nevada brewery in Chico. Bamforth is a frequent guest speaker at Sierra Nevada brewery and a close friend of Grossman. \"[The gift] reflects the close rapport that we enjoy with the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, which is the epitome of quality in the brewing industry,\" Bamforth said via email. \"Ken and Katie recognize that we are striving to deliver the very best people eager and ready to get into the industry.\" Grossman expressed similar sentiments regarding the relationship between UC Davis and Sierra Nevada Brewing. \"I have a long relationship with UC Davis, going back to the days of starting Sierra Nevada when I\\'d haunt the library to read material I couldn\\'t afford to subscribe to or was out of print,\" Grossman said via email. \"The goal [of the endowed brewer position] is to allow the program to continue its excellent work in educating brewers who are passionate, dedicated to quality and skilled at their craft.\" Serena Uppal, a third-year economics and mathematics double major, has recently become more interested in taking brewing classes due to the gift from Sierra Nevada Brewing. \"I would definitely be interested in taking a beer brewing class with this new funding,\" Uppal said. \"I won\\'t be just getting theoretical knowledge but also firsthand experience [in] the industry itself.\" \\xa0': 39,\n",
       " u' The second ASUCD Senate meeting of the new year was called to order by Vice President Abhay Sandhu on Jan. 19 at 6:14 p.m. in the Mee Room of the Memorial Union. Senator Sam Park was absent during quorum roll call and arrived late. Nisha Patel, a mental wellness student coordinator for Health Education and Promotion, started off the meeting with a presentation on the department\\'s current campaigns for consensual and safe sex. Patel also noted plans for a medical amnesty program to promote student wellness. Next, Yolo County supervisor Don Saylor discussed how the county supports its low-income community members through the Calfresh pantry and provides health care by using the Night\\'s Landing community as a poster child. After the presentations, the Senate discussed legislation. Aggie Public Arts Committee chairperson Suhaila Sikand proposed Senate Bill No. 32 to implement the downtown Davis piano project in the campus Quad. Senator Daniel Nagey suggested that the piano should have an ASUCD plaque since it will be providing the appropriate funds. The senators agreed and the resolution passed. Senator Samantha Chiang announced Senate Bill 33, which calls for the mandatory participation by ASUCD Senate and ex officio members in the Safe Zone and PEACE training. With further explanation, the bill passed. Scott Dresser, editor-in-chief of The California Aggie, introduced Senate Bill No. 34 to allow newspaper staff members to be paid in the form of weekly stipends, as opposed to hourly salaries, for the remainder of the 2016-2017 academic year. With no objections, the bill passed. Mason Schmidt, the Student Alumni Association president, proposed Senate Resolution No. 4 to change the association\\'s payment plan and to thank ASUCD for its assistance. The bill passed with no objections. The senate then moved into emergency legislation regarding the Milo Yiannopoulos event, hosted by the Davis College Republicans (DCR), during the previous week. Senators Chiang and Nagey discussed how ASUCD holds some responsibility for the event and the protests following since it provides support for the Club Finance Council (CFC), which funds the DCR. The senate emphasized that the CFC should not have given the DCR money for the event in the first place and that ASUCD condemns the DCR for violating the UC Davis Principles of Community. \"We should be taking responsibility for the part we had in this,\" Chiang said. \"Because of our funding, we have directly contributed to something that is harming our student body.\" Nagey also noted that interim Chancellor Ralph J. Hexter\\'s email to the UC Davis community was vague about the Yiannopoulos events. Nick Flores, the Internal Affairs Commission chair, added that the administration needs to be supportive of its students. Chiang called a resolution to condemn the DCR into question. The motion was seconded and passed in a vote of 11-1-0, with Senator Matthew Yamaguchi in opposition. The meeting then went into public discussion, during which student activists Sarah Shemery and Connor Gorman stressed their disappointment with senate members for not being present at the Yiannopoulos protest and for not showing support in response to the protest. Following a break, the senate introduced new legislation, including a constitutional amendment to form the judicial council and oversight committee of ASUCD. The meeting was adjourned by Sandhu at 9:30 p.m. \\xa0': 22,\n",

       " u' Thriving Pink offers free yoga sessions for cancer survivors at Fit House Davis For local cancer survivors, a new yoga program called \"Thriving Yoga\" is coming to Fit House Davis in February. Teaming up with nonprofit organization Thriving Pink, the program will offer four yoga classes free to \"anyone who has experienced cancer.\" There will be a social reception following each class, allowing participants to network and meet other survivors in the community. Thriving Pink is a relatively new nonprofit in the City of Davis. Founded in the summer of 2016, its members aim to help local breast cancer survivors thrive by engaging the community to provide a network of support for local women in Davis and have held a number of programs to do so over the past half-year. Thriving Yoga will be a welcomed addition to the lineup of upcoming events. These sessions will be instructed by Laura Murray and Blanche McNaughton. \"There\\'s no cost to attend, and we invite anyone who has experienced or has been affected by any form of cancer to participate and register,\" said Mary Liu, the executive director of Thriving Pink. \"It\\'s every Saturday in the month of February from 2 to 3 [p.m.] [ .] We\\'ve heard back from emails and phone calls that people are very excited and looking forward to it. And not just the yoga, but also the opportunity to connect with other cancer survivors in the Davis community.\" Yoga has been scientifically proven to have restorative powers in healing the mind, body and soul. Multiple studies by the University of Illinois, the University of California, Los Angeles and many more, have found that practicing yoga has many short and long-term effects on the body. During the observational study, researchers found that, right after a class, participants exhibited improved brain functions and lowered stress levels. After years of yoga practice, stronger bones and lower risk of heart disease were observed.  \"There\\'s some aspects of self acceptance that come along, you know?\" said Nick Dasklos, a yoga instructor at Akasha Yoga. \"People tend to look at it as a physical practice, but there\\'s a huge mental benefit. It\\'s really good for the parasympathetic nervous system, so it helps keep that fight-or-flight system off. When it comes on, you know how to deal with it [ ] You\\'ll be more in control of yourself. You just have a really nice, unique experience with yourself that no one else can explain for you.\" Besides organizing community events such as Thriving Yoga, Thriving Pink also has segments called Mentoring Pink, Granting Pink and Flashing Pink.  Mentoring Pink focuses on one-on-one mentoring for newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients. They are matched with compatible mentors and are then guided through their breast cancer journeys via emotional and practical support.  Granting Pink is an individual grant program sponsored by Wells Fargo that aids current patients with medical bills. The grants average about $1,000 in financial aid per recipient each year. Flashing Pink is an outreach program that interacts with the community through booths at the farmers market or through the flash mob series.  Flashing Pink will be present on Feb. 22 at the UC Davis women\\'s basketball game. Despite having been around for just about half a year, Thriving Pink is making significant efforts to bring the community together.

       " u' Tighter policies require greater approval of outside jobs Due to new policies implemented after the investigation of former UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.B. Katehi, University of California (UC) administrators are no longer seeking compensated board seats outside of their senior management jobs at the UC campuses. In 2015, the UC reported that the majority of approved board positions had compensation, with a total of $1.57 million for 42 managers. After establishment of the new policies, however, the 2016 report noted that 11 managers were approved for their outside activities from July 21 to Nov. 30, only three of which were paid positions that totalled to $9,510 in compensation. \"The new policy requires two levels of review and management approval,\" a UC report read. \"In addition, more detailed reviews are conducted to assess real or perceived conflicts of interest or commitment, and reputational risk.\" Activities now have to get approval through the campus chancellor, the president of the university or the chair of the Board of Regents. The 165 managers, which include UC President Janet Napolitano and campus chancellors, have also been limited to only two paid outside positions as opposed to the original three.  This decrease in UC administrators seeking additional compensated board seats comes after Katehi\\'s resignation last year, where she faced a series of controversies including holding seats on two for-profit boards. Bernadette Fox, a fourth year-international relations and women\\'s studies major, believes the policies are in place to give the UC administrators \"insurance\" and hide their mistakes. \"Katehi and [other chancellors] have really tarnished the brand of the UC in the last year or so,\" Fox said. \"By them being able to review these positions they can vet them and make sure from an outside perspective it doesn\\'t look bad for the UC as a whole. [ ] I think it kind of put them in check as far as how greedy [they] want to be.\" Emily Breuninger, a fifth-year sociology major, thought the policies were unsatisfactory and did not demonstrate progress in terms of addressing the large amount these administrators make beyond their outside jobs. \"If Katehi can get away with taking all of these outside board seats over years and years, and it passes by unnoticed, then I don\\'t see what\\'s there to stop other chancellors or senior administrators from doing the same thing,\" Breuninger said. \"I don\\'t think there [are] sufficient mechanisms to ensure that there aren\\'t conflicts of interest or that chancellors are prioritizing their campus duties over their outside seats.\" Although the managers are allowed to maintain the board positions they currently take on, Fox thinks the decrease in approved board positions is because the administrators are trying to avoid humiliation, and not solely because of Katehi. \"Everything that the UC does is very well calculated and is about protecting the expansion of the business model of the UC,\" Fox said. \"It\\'s embarrassing to me that it took what it did to get such basic policies put into place.\" Breuninger believes that such policies will not help bring about change at the chancellor level, since the main problems reside within the regents. \"If the regents are corrupt then everything is corrupt,\" Breuninger said. \"Their actions are more egregious.\" Breuninger added that the UC administrators are afraid of criticism and losing their jobs. \"I don\\'t think that [the policies have] to do with any sort of change in heart on their part,\" Breuninger said. \"This is something that\\'s in the public eye right now, so I don\\'t have any hope or optimism that once public attention is turned away from it they won\\'t go straight back to their usual operation.\"': 0,\n",

The 2017-18 tuition will increase by $282 and the student services fee will increase by $54 \\u2014 a $336 increase overall. It will be the first tuition increase since 2010. \"It was frustrating and disappointing to watch such a debate result in such a bad result, but I predict a worsening affordability crisis among UC students,\" said ASUCD President Alex Lee via email. \"Officially [the UC Regents] claim 2/3 of students will not feel the increase because of increased financial aid, but that still leaves 1/3 (thousands of students!) who will feel the punch of $336 a year.\" UC Regent Gavin Newsom, who voted against the tuition increase, released a statement on Thursday after the vote. \"We talk about how much we value the middle-class, yet this decision doesn\\'t demonstrate that commitment to the middle-class,\" Newsom said. \"New York is moving toward free education while California moves toward increasing its cost. We are heading in the wrong direction and today\\'s decision has let Sacramento off the hook from reinvesting in public higher education and offering all Californians a place of ascent on the ladder of economic mobility.\"': 30,\n",
       " u' UC Board of Regents creates position of student advisor to the student regent Every year, the University of California (UC) appoints a new student regent, a member of one of the nine UC campuses, who becomes a voting member within the Board of Regents. The student regent serves one year as a student regent designate, where they become a non-voting member on the board until their term commences on July 1. They attend all six meetings throughout the year to represent UC students and their best interests.  Any UC student in good academic standing may apply to be the student regent. The southern and northern regional UC student nominating commissions each select five semifinalists, a total of 10, from those who apply. These semifinalists are then interviewed by the UC Student Association (UCSA) board of directors. The board chooses three applicants, who are then interviewed by the Regents\\' Special Committee to Select a Student Regent. The committee then recommends a nominee to the full board of UC Regents, which votes on the nominee.  According to Claire Doan, media specialist for the UC, the student regent adds a student perspective to the board.   \"The goal is to give the Board of Regents a more comprehensive student perspective on university issues, so that student concerns and priorities are reflected in Regents\\' decision-making,\" Doan said.  Duties of the student regent include contributing to policy establishment in areas such as long-range planning, student fees, admissions and compensation. The student regent helps oversee the financial management of the University and also helps to appoint the president of the University, the 10 campus chancellors and the officers of the regents.  The current student regent for the 2016-2017 academic school year is Marcela Ramirez, a Ph.D. graduate student in higher education administration and policy at UC Riverside. Ramirez is currently serving as the graduate student representative on the UC Office of the President LGBT Advisory Committee and was previously a member of the Undocumented Student Task Force at UC Riverside. She also served as the founding director of the Middle Eastern Student Center and as the diversity initiatives coordinator in the Dean of Students Office at UC Riverside. Ramirez has accomplished many things so far as student regent, including being a part of the UC Davis chancellor search committee.  \"I have served on several committees including the sexual assault and sexual violence task force, the UC Davis Chancellor\\'s search committee, as well as the search committee for the UCOP Vice President of Student Affairs,\" Ramirez said. \"I am currently on the academic affairs and student affairs committee, as well as the public engagement committee. The largest responsibility is making sure that student perspectives and interests are represented on all these fronts.\"  The current UC regent designate is UC Berkeley law student Paul Monge. He is a non-voting regent-designate until his student regent term begins on July 1. He will be the 43rd student regent since the position was established in 1975.  Monge has previously held various leadership positions. He served as student body president for UC Santa Barbara, was a budget analyst for the San Francisco Unified School District, a legislative aide for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, a health and human services policy analyst for Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City and a commissioner on the San Francisco Youth Commission. Monge is currently the system wide graduate student representative on the University Committee on Planning and Budget, advising the UC on policies regarding capital planning, budget development and resource allocation. He is also a community advisory committee member for the San Francisco Public Education Enrichment Fund. Monge plans to focus on issues of housing affordability and food insecurity, the need for proper handling of allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault on campuses and expanded access to culturally comprehensive mental health services. \"As student regent I will work to ensure that the voices of students are both respected and reflected in the decision-making processes of the Board of Regents,\" Monge said. \"I plan to leverage my background in policy advocacy and community organizing to help prioritize some of the most pressing issues affecting students today.\" In January 2016, the Board of Regents approved a two-year pilot program creating a non-voting position titled Student Advisor, who is appointed for a term of one year and is selected from the student population not represented by the Student Regent during the same term of service. A candidate for Student Advisor must be an undergraduate, graduate or professional student in good standing at one of the UC\\'s 10 campuses. The position will begin in July 2017. Applications for undergraduate student advisor and the 2018-2019 student regent are now available online.  \\xa0': 47,\n",
       " u' UC Davis leads in sustainability with largest solar power plant of any university The University of California\\'s 13th Annual Report on Sustainable Practices was presented at the UC Board of Regents meeting on Jan. 25. The 2016 report relays both the UC\\'s successes and challenges ahead in regards to renewable energy, water conservation, waste reduction, food sustainability and UC-wide sustainability goals. \"We\\'re attacking this challenge on multiple fronts \\u2014 undertaking basic and applied research, teaching, changing the way we operate, investing in climate change solutions and being a model of positive change,\" said UC President Janet Napolitano in the report. The report highlights UC Davis\\' implementation of its 16.3 MW large solar power plant, the largest known on any university campus, which generates approximately 33 million kilowatt hours for the campus and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by about 14,000 metric tons annually. UC Davis has been consistently meeting or approaching UC-wide sustainability goals. The campus achieved the 2014 policy goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 2000 levels, diverted 73 percent of its waste from the landfill and reduced growth-adjusted potable water consumption by 36 percent from the 2020 baseline, thereby achieving the 2025 policy goal early. Camille Kirk, assistant director of sustainability at UC Davis, cited additional instances in which UC Davis has been at the forefront of sustainability. \"UC Davis continues to demonstrate leadership in sustainability, through efforts like [ ] investing in our pathways and bikeways to enable sustainable transportation and achieving a 27 percent reduction in water use at the Davis campus over the past year,\" Kirk said via email. Llyod Knox, a physics professor at UC Davis, also believes that UC Davis is at the forefront of increased sustainability. \"Student activism initially stirred the university conversation about reducing our carbon emissions all the way to zero,\" Knox said via email. \"In 2013 Janet Napolitano declared we would do it by 2025. UC Davis is a leader in the system on this front, doing more to realize this goal than any of the other campuses.\" A program launched systemwide in 2016 aims to give students the tools to face global climate change. In the summer of 2016, faculty across the UC system attended workshops to develop new material incorporating climate change and sustainability into existing courses.  \"Preparing our students to be leaders in the areas of climate change and environmental sustainability is no longer an option; it is an imperative,\" Napolitano said in the report. UC Davis offers many classes on sustainability, climate science and research on environmental and sustainability questions. Students also voted in 2016 to establish the Green Initiative Fund, which supports sustainability projects and student internships. \"Here at UC Davis we view the university as a living laboratory, where we are finding and implementing solutions that will be adopted elsewhere,\" Knox said via email. \"Students can get involved, contribute and learn useful skills, through project-based courses.\" Two interdisciplinary courses, A Path to Zero Net Energy: A Hands-on Approach (ABT 289A) and Pathways to Climate Neutrality in California (PHY150), are open to non-science majors. In both classes, students can work in small teams on real-world carbon emission reduction projects. ABT 289A will be taught by biological and agricultural engineering professor Kurt Kornbluth in the spring of 2017 and PHY150 will be taught by physics professor Lloyd Knox in the fall of 2017. UC Santa Barbara, UCLA and UC Berkeley have already surpassed the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions level, which they were supposed to stay under until 2020.  In order to reach the 2025 goal UCs will need to reduce emissions by over 1 million metric tons of CO2. This would equate to taking approximately 850,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year. Unfortunately, current efforts are not enough to reach carbon neutrality systemwide by 2025.': 2,\n",
       " u' UC Davis researchers receive funding for salmon study Record level numbers of Chinook salmon have been spawning in Putah Creek this winter, likely as a result of improved drought and habitat conditions and various management practices in the region.  \"Around 1,500 salmon have been recorded spawning in Putah Creek this winter,\" said Peter Moyle, a professor emeritus in the Department of Wildlife, Fish and Conservation Biology. Some researchers have argued that there may even be close to 2,000 salmon spawning there currently, a significant increase from last year\\'s numbers. During 2016, around 500 to 700 salmon were recorded spawning in Putah Creek. \\xa0 Researchers studying the area were surprised and pleased with the increasing numbers of salmon present today. During the 1970s, only a few salmon were recorded in the creek, and, in 2014, numbers were still significantly low, with some 200 salmon observed.  \"Since 1999, the species of Chinook salmon present in the Sacramento river region have been identified as a Species of Concern,\" according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\'s (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service. Poor habitat conditions, the drought and local dams cutting off adequate spawning habitat for the fish contributed to the lower observed numbers recognized over the years.  Moyle proposed that it is new salmon, likely from hatcheries throughout the region that did not originally spawn in Putah Creek, that are coming into the creek now because of increased river flows. Colder water, adequate habitat and established management and restoration projects on the creek have also improved conditions for successful salmon spawning.  During December 2016, researchers at UC Davis received $125,000 from the Solano County Water Agency (SCWA) for a study that aims to track the number of juvenile salmon that are present in Putah Creek. Through this genetic study, researchers will be able to understand which and how many fish are native to the creek. This knowledge will be able to guide decision-makers about which creek management choices to make for successful salmon survival conditions.  \"I think it\\'s great to have better scientific knowledge about these fish [ ] Hopefully it can help us shape how we manage the creek so that we can enhance the habitat further,\" said Chris Lee, principal water resources specialist for the SCWA.  For now, the improved habitat and the increasing numbers of Chinook salmon spawning in Putah Creek has indicated that this ecosystem is recovering, as are the numbers of other kinds of species local to the area too.  Moyle believes that with a continued rainy year ahead, the creek may hold even more salmon in the future.': 83,\n",
       " u' UC Davis-led institute one of five national transportation centers awarded under the University Transportation Centers program The U.S. Department of Transportation announced in early December that it had selected the National Center for Sustainable Transportation (NCST), led by the UC Davis Institute of Transportation Studies, to receive a five-year $14 million federal grant to work on a more sustainable transportation system.  The NCST is one of five national transportation centers awarded under the University Transportation Centers\\' program that was reauthorized by the federal Fixing America\\'s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. It is the only national transportation center focused on environmental preservation and the only one in California. The NCST is part of UC Davis\\' Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS-Davis). Other institutions partnered with the NCST are California State University, Long Beach; UC Riverside; University of Southern California; Georgia Tech and the University of Vermont. \\xa0 The institution works on improving the environmental sustainability of transportation \\xa0nationwide. The institution helps federal, state, regional and local agencies reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from passenger and freight travel that contribute to climate change. Its goal is to enhance the environmental sustainability of the United States\\' transportation system through reducing fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.  \"Our research is organized around three themes, each essential to the goal of sustainability: environmentally responsible infrastructure and operations, multimodal travel and sustainable land use and zero-emission vehicle and fuel technology,\" said Susan Handy, the NCST director and an environmental science and policy professor.  Handy believes that finding more eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives to modern transportation are highly important. \\xa0 \"Preserving the environment is called out in federal policy as a priority research area, for good reason,\" Handy said. \"The transportation system is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. It degrades water quality, increases noise levels, fragments natural habitat [and] creates barriers within our communities. All of these impacts have consequences for human health, social equity, economic vitality and our overall quality of life [ ] now and into the future.\" Since its creation in 2012, the NCST has funded 68 research projects on topics related to sustainable transportation. The NCST also published 25 white papers written to help policymakers address critical sustainability issues. It has worked with influential leaders and stakeholder groups, making it a leader in advancement of environmentally sustainable transportation and making UC Davis as a whole the nation\\'s leading university on sustainable transportation. With the federal grant, the NCST plans to launch new research initiatives that will focus on the electrification, sharing and automation of passenger vehicles, as well as the development of more educational programs, not just for graduate students but also for undergraduates and high school students.  Dahlia Garas, the NCST program manager, believes that, with this federal grant, the institute will be able to efficiently find alternatives that are affordable and a positive resource for everyone.  \"Finding win-win solutions that reduce environmental impacts while enhancing the economy and making travel easier, affordable and more convenient will provide a better future for everyone,\" Garas said. Carina Tejada, a fourth-year community and regional development major, believes it is important that a school known for its emphasis on agriculture work to continue to make a positive environmental impact.

The teach-ins provided an outlet for UC Davis professors and guest scholars to explore President Trump\\'s potential impact on civil, political, racial and sexual rights. The union also included a list of demands to the University of California (UC) which included denouncing Trump\\'s presidency and democratizing the UC Regents administration. \\xa0\\xa0 On its Facebook page and website, the union highlights discrimination that its members believe the new president has helped perpetuate. \"We must take action as students, workers, faculty, and staff against the racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and ableism that Trump has normalized in this country, both structurally and rhetorical,\" the organization said. \"All UCD students, staff, and faculty are encouraged to participate in the walkout and express resistance to the incoming Trump regime in whatever manner they find most appropriate, be it protest, teach-ins, or simply staying at home with a good book.\"  The United Automobile Workers (UAW), which houses the UC Student Workers Union \\u2013 Davis, is comprised of 600 nationwide chapters. UAW 2865 represents the 16,000 University of California student-faculty from every UC campus. Connor Gorman, a UAW 2865 organizer in the Davis chapter, described this inauguration day as an opportunity to protest both the new presidential administration and UC Davis administration. \"We called for a walkout in order to protest the Trump administration, but also to protest the larger structural issues that he\\'s just the latest manifestation of,\" Gorman said. \"All of these systems of oppression and the various inequalities created have been around since the formation of the U.S. and in other countries prior to that, so these aren\\'t new things. It\\'s a larger structural issue.\" The UAW 2865 also has 11 demands listened on its website and Facebook page. The union describes its demands as advocating for the marginalized, such as undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ people, along with restoring a democratic higher education.  \"We are also making demands of the UC because there are many things that relate to Trump but also relate to the UC,\" Gorman said. \"For instance, we are demanding that the UC formally make all of the campuses sanctuaries. We also want to democratize the regents. Right now, the structure of the UC is very undemocratic, it\\'s very corporate, they don\\'t listen to students or workers or community members, and we want more say in that.\"  The demands include denouncing Donald Trump\\'s presidency, fully demilitarizing UC campuses and implementing free education and healthcare. The demand of democratizing the Regents\\' administration relates back to last year\\'s Democratize UC movement. \\xa0 Tobias Warner, a faculty member in the Department of French and Italian who attended a teach-in, views education as an important and challenging factor amidst the new political climate. \"I think our primary job as faculty is teaching,\" Warner said. \"At a time when many of the missions of the University are thrown into question by incoming administration and some of its declared policies, the faculty should continue to teach. That\\'s why I\\'m here.\"  Iris Bloomfield, a fourth-year English major who attended the teach-ins, is worried about the new White House administration but expressed a commitment to maintaining a reparative dialogue. \\xa0 \"If anyone has been paying attention to the kind of conflicts that have come to the light of day as Trump has campaigned and won, whether we want to contest that title of president or not, I\\'m concerned,\" Bloomfield said. \"I know that plenty of other folks are concerned and I think one of the most important things we can do right now is get together and have conversations about where we need to be organizing and what people are most concerned about.\"  Bloomfield and other concerned students will continue to bolster disenfranchised community members around them and assist in the anti-Trump movement.  \"I\\'m certainly [interested] in showing up, listening and helping out where I can in order to work to make sure that we have resources and are making an effort to protect the most vulnerable around us right now,\" Bloomfield said. \\xa0': 42,\n",
       " u' UC tuition, fees could rise by $363 per student by fall 2017  The University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) systems are considering tuition increases after a five-year tuition freeze.  UC tuition currently sits at $12,294 per year, and CSU tuition is $5,472 annually. Each campus has its own fees that can increase the cost of tuition above the baseline rate. Tuition costs have recently held steady despite declining fiscal support from the state for higher education. \"Tuition at the University of California has remained flat for the past six years, despite the decline in state support,\" said Claire Doan, a UC spokesperson, via e-mail. \"The state has gone from covering 72 percent of the cost of educating a California student in 2000 to 41 percent last year.\" Doan also stressed that any tuition increase would be covered through financial aid for 65 percent of UC students. Although CSU tuition costs less than half of UC tuition, the CSU system could approve tuition increases of around $300, according to a Los Angeles Times article. A UC press release also announced that the UC Regents will consider a $282 tuition increase and a $54 student service fee for mental health resources later this month. Each system would implement possible tuition increases during the 2017-2018 school year. According to Elizabeth Chapin, a CSU spokesperson, increasing tuition is not the system\\'s first option. \"There is currently not a plan to increase tuition, but it could be an option if the state does not fully fund the CSU,\" Chapin said via e-mail. \"As of right now, there is a $168 million gap between the CSU\\'s preliminary budget plan for 2017-2018 and the state\\'s funding plan.\" Apart from tuition increases, Chapin said that the CSU system might also consider budget cuts. To avoid this, CSU officials will continue working with Governor Jerry Brown to secure adequate funding. \"If the state does not fund the gap, the CSU may need to consider difficult options including significantly scaling back support budget request priorities,\" Chapin said via e-mail. \"CSU leaders, students and stakeholders will work with the governor and state legislative leaders to advocate for increased funding for the CSU to ensure that the university has the resources needed to continue to provide affordable, high-quality degrees to California students.\" In November, students at UC Davis staged a walk-out protest against potential tuition hikes. Parker Spadaro, a first-year undeclared student in the College of Letters and Sciences who helped organize the event, hopes that there will be more protests against increasing the tuition, but also acknowledged that it can be difficult for students to make the time to participate. \"That\\'s where we\\'re put in a bind as students \\u2014 we have to take time for classes, we have take time for work, we have to take time for studying, we have to take time for socializing and we have to take time for rest,\" Spadaro said via e-mail. \"Finding the time to organize and participate in demonstrations against injustices like tuition raises are so limited in available time despite their necessity.\" Spadaro explained that they are opposed to tuition increases in principle because tuition is already at unreasonable levels. \"Well if you can\\'t tell by now, [my position on increases is] definitely negative,\" Spadaro said via e-mail. \"The [present] cost of education is classist, sexist and racist [ ] Yet we still think of this country as the land of opportunity and the media, politicians, bourgeoisie and other working class individuals shove the idea of the American dream on us.\" Spadaro advocates for a tuition decrease rather than an increase. \"I think I\\'ve already made it obvious [that] tuition should actually be decreased,\" Spadaro said via e-mail. \"They should decrease as the university\\'s investments mature and start profiting until the university\\'s investments can completely cover tuition.\" Ralph Washington Jr., the president of the UC Student Association and a UC Davis graduate student, spoke of the time when tuition was free. \"Originally, many years ago, tuition was free for California residents [ ],\" Washington said. \"I think that one reason that students are requesting for a tuition decrease, a rollback, is to try and create a precedent to go back to the way the cost of education was at some point before.\" According to Washington, free tuition at schools like the UC schools would send a strong message about society\\'s views regarding the value of higher education.': 54,\n",
       " u' University accused of violating state labor laws, bad faith bargaining The University of California member-run union, International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 2010, will hold a one-day strike on all 10 UC campuses, five UC medical centers and the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab on Tuesday, Jan. 10. The strike aims to bring attention to supposed violations of state labor laws and bad faith bargaining from the University as well as demonstrate support for skilled trade workers on strike at UCLA. Those on strike will include administrative support workers at all UC campuses along with electricians, elevator mechanics, facility workers and plumbers at UCLA and UC San Diego, amounting to around 12,800 workers. The Teamsters provided ample notice of the strike to the University to ensure public safety, especially at the medical centers. It is advised that the public reschedule all non-essential medical appointments on Jan. 10.  The Teamsters will use the Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) strike as a platform to engage with the University in a conversation regarding alleged violations of state labor laws. \"Our Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) strike is over the University\\'s violations of state law which have been numerous and include bargaining in bad faith, stalling negotiations, interfering with our right to engage in Union activities, unilaterally changing work rules and management threatening retaliation for participating in a strike action,\" said Christian Castro, Teamster communications director, via e-mail. The University disputes these claims and cites a lack of justification for the strike. According to executive director of Strategic Communications Dianne Klein, the University is still bargaining with the Teamsters and provides its workers with a competitive wage. \"We strongly disagree that there is any basis for this strike,\" Klein said via e-mail. \"We are still bargaining with the Teamsters.\"  Klein says that the University has offered the workers an 18 percent wage increase over six years, lower premiums for their health insurance and more choices for their pension plans.  In defense of the strike, the Teamsters cited a study by Occidental College that demonstrated 7 out of 10 UC workers face food insecurity due to a 24 percent wage decline over the past two decades. However, according to Teamster Research Analyst Timothy Mathews, the strike is not primarily to demand more pay, but rather to initiate conversation with the University about unfair labor practices.  \"The University has demonstrated patterns of disrespect,\" Mathews said. \"We\\'re hopeful [UC President] Janet Napolitano will take initiative to show leadership.\" Students and faculty plan to experience delays due to the strike. Teamsters also plan to picket and hold rallies at strategic locations around the state. Strikers plan to refuse deliveries of food, laundry, construction materials and UPS packages.  \\xa0': 55,\n",
       " u' Volunteer program distributes bicycles, aims to foster positive biking experiences Davis, California \\u2014 home to thousands of cyclists and bicycles. It is the city that introduced bike lanes to our country, and it is often referred to as \"The Bicycle Capital of the U.S.\" The Davis city logo proudly features a penny-farthing, 98 percent of the city\\'s streets have some sort of bicycle provision and navigating a bike circle for the first time is a rite of passage for incoming UC Davis students. Judging by all of this, one might imagine that all Davis residents and all UC Davis students like bicycles \\u2014 but that is not the case. According to the recently released 2015 to 2016 UC Davis Campus Travel Survey, only 45.3 percent of UC Davis students bike to class. Commuting to campus from out of town contributes significantly to the amount of students who don\\'t bike, but some simply do not like bicycles. Sarah McBride, a third-year psychology major, does not enjoy biking around campus. \"I liked [bicycles] a lot when I was younger, but I don\\'t really like riding them around Davis,\" McBride said. \"There are so many bike riders here that it\\'s not an enjoyable experience anymore.\"  Brett Stults, a third-year English major, cites a general lack of awareness for the rules of biking as a reason he does not bike. \"[Bikes are] vehicles, so they have to stop at stop signs, they have to ride in the correct direction of traffic, they have to not ride on sidewalks,\" Stults said. \"That\\'s a big pet peeve of mine. It\\'s a sidewalk, not a sidebike. I think that if you\\'re going to do it, you need to do it with proper respect for all those who are involved.\" Maria Contreras Tebbutt, a local biking advocate, believes that training and guidance can go a long way for those who don\\'t like biking. She aims to help more residents and students have positive experiences with biking through her nonprofit volunteer project, The Bike Campaign. The Bike Campaign provides bicycles to those who cannot afford them, holds bike clinics, provides bike training for riders of all ages and runs a bicycle garage in Woodland where you can have your bicycle repaired by volunteer mechanics or learn how to work on bicycles yourself. The overall goal of The Bike Campaign is to build appreciation for bicycles. \"Riding a bike was not on your SAT, nor is it in your DNA,\" Tebbutt said. \"So, you need people to guide the way for you, to share information with you. You\\'re not going to find it on the Internet, because it\\'s something that you physically do. Every situation is different, every bicycle is different, every rider is different. And finding all those pieces that come together so you have bliss, that\\'s what we\\'re aiming for.\" Tebbutt has been passionate about biking since the age of 12 and does everything she can to share her passion with the community. She believes biking is not only a useful alternative to driving, but a lifestyle with great community and health benefits. \"I would wish for more people to be able to enjoy what we enjoy in Davis, which is a lifestyle,\" Tebbutt said. \"I think [biking] causes us to care more deeply about the people around us, our environment, I think bike riders just have that opportunity to be much more aware, much more alive and alert and, you know, tuned into what\\'s going on around them. [ ] It\\'s way better than taking a multivitamin. It helps support your health.\" The Bike Campaign restores abandoned bicycles and donates them to those who cannot afford to buy a bike on their own. \"If we can harvest [abandoned bicycles], restore them, and then present them to somebody with some basic bike appreciation information so that they have a great experience, I\\'d like to do it a thousand times over every year,\" Tebbutt said. Tebutt encourages anyone who would like to get into biking to contact her. She can be reached from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at (530) 753-1125, or via e-mail at funmaria@sbcglobal.net.

       " u' Volunteers to complete day-to-day management tasks, guest screening during November to March season The Interfaith Rotating Winter Shelter (IRWS) is seeking volunteers for two positions to help with day-to-day management tasks and guest screening during its upcoming November to March season.  Those on the host site team will perform tasks such as helping with volunteer sign-ups and making sure the organization is running smoothly, while those on the shelter operations team will coordinate the intake process for guests and will help maintain the shelter conditions as the host site changes. IRWS, an almost fully volunteer-run organization, provides a homeless shelter to Davis locals. On a given night, the shelter supports 25 to 45 guests, providing each of them with hot meals and a place to sleep, including a cot and a sleeping bag.  \"We are the only emergency homeless shelter in Davis,\" said Eric Elton, board of directors chairman for IRWS.  Elton added that the shelter does not have a waiting list and takes guests regardless of sobriety.  The Yolo County Homeless Count 2015, an annual report completed by the Yolo County Homeless and Poverty Action Coalition (HPAC), reported that on the night of Jan. 26, 2015, 131 individuals in Davis were considered homeless. This number varies on a nightly basis; the count does not include individuals who may spend their nights at friends\\' residences or in foster homes.  Jose Jimenez, an advocate for the homeless in Davis and associate for Street Medicine Sacramento, stressed the seriousness of the issue. \"Substance abuse is a main reason for homelessness,\" Jimenez said. Jimenez said that in order to successfully tackle the issue, local programs need more funding and community-based participation. While in a given year some 1,500 individuals contribute their time to help IRWS, more volunteers are still needed. Both volunteer and internship positions are offered at IRWS each year, though internship applications are no longer being accepted for this season.  Volunteers and interns alike have benefited greatly from their experiences with the organization. Marie Belen, who is now beginning her third year as an intern for the IRWS, fondly recalls talking to a guest about a shared interest.  \"It was really neat because at the moment we were connecting,\" Belen said. Belen believes that working at IRWS has positively changed her perceptions about homelessness and has given her a chance to interact with others in the community. She said that the IRWS is a great place to start helping the homeless since it offers a supportive and safe atmosphere. For more information about joining IRWS, visit its website at interfaith-shelter.org or e-mail irwsteam@gmail.com.

A protest in support of free speech.\" Although the protest was scheduled to begin at 1 p.m., Yiannopoulos did not arrive until about 1:50 p.m.  Yiannopoulos spoke for about 10 minutes to the crowd. In his speech, he claimed that DCR was pressured into cancelling his speaking event. \"Your university is trying to claim that the College Republicans cancelled the event last night,\" Yiannopoulos said. \"Well that\\'s only true to a point. It\\'s true because they were told by the police that they would be responsible for property damage [ ] so the university heavily pressured the College Republicans [to cancel it].\" When pressed as to why he chose to continue his speaking tour, Yiannopoulos said that he wanted to remind people that they can always express themselves. \"What I\\'m trying to do with the tour is remind people that nothing bad happens if you use words you\\'re not supposed to use,\" Yiannopoulos said. \"And words only have the power you give them. People should be free to express themselves however they want.\" Yiannopoulos and the protesters marched throughout campus before reenacting the 2011 pepper spray incident with silly string that Yiannopoulos had brought with him. While some actively countered Yiannopoulos\\' protest at the MU, other demonstrators from the night before decided to host a fundraiser for the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter at Davis\\' Central Park. \"We organized the protest last night and it was effective and it worked \\u2014 we shut it down,\" said Bernadette Fox, a fourth-year international relations and women\\'s studies double major. \"This morning everybody was so drained. We woke up and it was like \\'oh great, they\\'re coming back.\\' So we came to the consensus that we didn\\'t feel like we had the numbers really to [ ] shut it down again and we also saw all over Milo\\'s page and the Davis College Republicans\\' [page] a lot of people asking like other self-identified white supremacist-type of people who are very violent to come, so we anticipated that there would be a high level chance for people to get hurt and we didn\\'t want to put people in danger.\"': 50,\n",
       " u' \\xa0 \\xa0 Davis Manor neighborhood\\'s newest street addition What started a couple of years ago as a spark of interest to improve the Davis Manor neighborhood, ignited the idea to create a street mural. Throughout the process, those working on the mural came to the realization that building community relations was just as important as completing the finished work. About a year and a half ago, the Davis Manor Creative Action Team (CAT) drafted a proposal for a grant to obtain some of the necessary funding to make its mural project a reality. In this proposal, UC Davis alumna and local artist Danielle Fodor was chosen to help out with the mural\\'s painting. In addition to receiving significant donations from businesses and individual fundraising, the Civic Arts Commission awarded the group a grant of approximately $4,000.  The idea for this mural originally stemmed from Mark Lakeman, head of The City Repair Project in Portland, Or.. While Lakeman was in the area, the Davis Manor Council invited him to speak about his organization, which had goals to reclaim public areas and fill them with artwork which spoke to the community and drew people together.  \"I met with community members maybe more than a year and a half ago to talk about the whole concept of community art and localized street design issues that can enhance community,\" said Davis mayor Robb Davis. \"And I was very supportive about them being experimental and coming to us with ideas, even if it meant changing street configuration.\" After obtaining the necessary budget as well as community support to complete the project, the council began to plan out three workshops during which community members could gather to voice their design ideas. This enabled the public to decide what was really important to them and what neighborhood values they thought were most meaningful. \"At first, the ideas all seemed really different and impossible to put together,\" Fodor said. \"But what it really comes down to is [that] you end up talking about the core values of your community, and they always end up overlapping. And as we started working together, the design really starts to coalesce.\" An average of 20 people attended each of the workshops, but when it came to the final paint days, there were about 150 people. The mural, which was originally supposed to be 1,400 square feet, ended up at about 5,000 square feet due to the vast number of ideas that residents kept incorporating into the mural\\'s planning process. \"This is a community that really cares about inclusion, they really care about diversity, they really care about creativity,\" Fodor said. \"And so it really made sense for them to have a design that had lots of little things going on that were all connected but were also allowed to sing their own song \\u2013\\u2013 to be what they were going to be individually.\" Community members of all ages were allowed to be a part of the painting process, whether or not they had any prior artistic experience. \"There were probably 5-year-olds painting all the way up to 80-year-olds painting, or maybe even older,\" Davis said. Parents, their children and UC Davis students ranging from local to international all helped paint, and other artists even came from as far as Rancho Cordova, Calif.. \"People go to being neighbors, rather than people who just happen to live by each other,\" said Rachel Hartsough, arts and culture program manager for the City of Davis. \"[The mural] affects the people in that neighborhood for sure. It gives people a sense of how we can come together and have a big impact on working collaboratively, whether in arts or other facets in our community.\" A potluck dinner was thrown for the mural that Friday, Oct. 20 and Saturday, Oct. 21, with live music adding to the already jubilant mood. Many were excited about the mural because it would be a place where people could meet, hang out or simply come to enjoy its beauty. \"We missed out on having some of the public parks and other amenities that other neighborhoods had,\" said Robin Kozloff, a Davis Manor neighbor who helped to facilitate the mural. \"We sort of need a place to gather, and so a mural on the street could actually provide that.\" What was really special about this mural was that a water-based asphalt coating was used, which has a relatively short shelf-life. Comparatively, normal acrylic has a shelf life of a couple years. The use of this shorter shelf-life coating was the first time that this medium had been used for murals in Davis, and will last longer than other paints and prevent it from deterioration due to weathering.  A significant amount of research, planning and time was poured into the street mural project, which served to unify the community. \"These community projects are always really humbling to me because we think that we\\'re so big and powerful, and that the decisions we make are so important,\" Fodor said. \"But really, it\\'s the decisions we make as groups, and it\\'s when we work together, that we\\'re able to reach beyond our wildest dreams.\" \\xa0': 117}"
