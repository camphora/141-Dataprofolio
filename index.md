## Welcome to my Data Profolio Page

### About Me
I am Shu Zhang, a Master student in biostatistics in UC davis. I studied Biomedical Engineering as my undergraduate major in the university in Nanjing, China and then entered davis to switch my major to Biostatitics. I am always interested biological and medical science and also very enthusiastic about mathematic science and statistics. Therefore  I chose Biostatitcs as my major and hoped to employ data analysis method in the fields one day. 

### Data Profilo for STA141B
In the class of [STA141B](https://jsharpna.github.io/141B/index.html), I practiced my method and technique for data analysis and visualization, moreover I learn Python and truly shape my Python skills. Here,  I would show some of my assignment and my final project to show what I have learned in this course.


### Practices 

#### [API acquirement and analysis](https://github.com/camphora/141-Dataprofolio/blob/master/assignment4_new%20.ipynb)
API and its application is crucial in the field of data science. With the API:[USDA Food Composition Databases](https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list), I managed to get data from web successfully and then used pandas module to process them. At last, with thoroughly analysis of API data， I visualized my findings with matplotlib module.

#### [Web scarpping and Natural Langauage Processing(NLP)](https://github.com/camphora/141-Dataprofolio/blob/master/assignment5_1.ipynb)
In this section, I scraped text from The California Aggie and then analyze the text. Using NLP method and python module nltk to analyze news from [aggie news](https://theaggie.org/).


#### [SQL query and analysis about database ](https://github.com/camphora/141-Dataprofolio/blob/master/assignment6_0.ipynb)
According to the database sf_data([download here](http://anson.ucdavis.edu/~nulle/sf_data.sqlite), I used SQL to extract and analysis data. Then, I used geopandas module(map) to further interpret some results.


### Project
[Our project](https://kevinxucong.github.io/141B/) is about tweet data analysis and interpretation of President Donald Trump, we got the basic idea and enlightment by David Robinson's [excellent work](http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) and derive our unique analysis and conclusions.
